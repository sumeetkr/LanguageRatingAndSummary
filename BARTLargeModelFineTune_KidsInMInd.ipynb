I\\'ll break his freaking arm.That\\'s great, but that\\'s not what I meant.You see, there\\'s a way\\nthat we talk to our kids.For instance, where you would say \"No\"...we would say,\\n\"Consider the consequences.\"Or where you would say, \"Don\\'t\"...we would say, \"Maybe you should try this.\"Or where you would say...\"Quit your whining,\\nyou\\'re giving me a headache\"...we would say, \"Use your words.\"You see, that way, the child feelsthat he has value, he has worth.He is heard.It\\'s a way.Let\\'s order.Great.That\\'s very good, but if you stayinside the lines, it looks better.Here, look at mine, see?Dad, we don\\'t really worry about lines.Honey, draw whatever\\nyour imagination tells you.But what\\'s the point\\nof having lines if you\\'re just going to...?Artie.That\\'s beautiful.\\nThat\\'s absolutely beautiful.It\\'s very avant-garde.- Picasso.\\n- Exactly.You didn\\'t finish your dinner.\\nYou know the great thing about Chinese...I mean, Pan Asian food,\\nis that if you mush it all up it\\'s...- What happened?- What did you do?\\n- I don\\'t know.He doesn\\'t like his food to touch.I didn\\'t know!

It g-gets too wet.- Is this the right amount?\\n- Uh-uh.Well, eat fast.Okay. Here you go.You have to cut up the berries...and put one piece in each hole\\nin the multigrain waffle.This food can touch?Eggless egg salad coming up.Okay, put the lettuce, hit it with the lettuce.It\\'s fine, they will never know.No crust, no crust.Now there\\'s no sandwich.\\nLook what you made.I like them, Carl likes them. Right, Carl?And your opinion has value.\\nAnd, what\\'s the other one?Worth.But I know from experience\\nthat wearing heels can be tricky.Especially during recess.Wouldn\\'t you and Carl\\nboth be more comfortable in sneakers?No.Hey, what\\'s going on?\\nWe are going to be late.<i>It\\'s Project Hun way.</i>l tried handling\\nit like Alice said, but it\\'s not working.All right,\\nget the other two in the car, I\\'ll handle this.Artie.It\\'s okay. Let me try.Take off those shoes\\nand I\\'ll give you a dollar.- Five.\\n- Two-fifty.Deal.Just punch in \"go to school.\"Why is this easier than\\nyou just telling me how to get there?- l heard <i>that.</i>\\n- Whoa!

Long time ago.Brooklyn Dodgers,\\nNew York Giants.And they hated each other.L-Like Luke S-Skywalker and D-Darth Vader.Worse.Well, the baseball season ends\\nand they\\'re tied.Now, this one game would decide...who would go to the World Seriesagainst the great New York Yankees.Biggest game in the history of New York.Bottom of the ninth inning, two outs,the Giants are losing 4 to 2...and a batter\\nnamed Bobby Thomson comes up to bat.<i>Bobby Thomson\\nup there swinging.</i><i>He \\'5 had two out of three,</i><i>a single and a double, and Billy Cox is--</i>Close your eyes. Close your eyes, come on.Close your eyes and you can see it.<i>Bobby hitting at .292.</i><i>Lockman without\\ntoo big of a lead at secondÂ\\x93</i><i>but he \\'ll be running like the wind\\nif Thomson hits one.</i><i>Branca throws.</i><i>There\\'s a long drive!\\nIt\\'s gonna be, I believe--</i><i>The Giants win the pennant!</i><i>The Giants win the pennant!\\nThe Giants win the pennant!</i><i>The Giants win the pennant!</i><i>Bobby Thomson hits\\ninto the lower deck of the left field stands!</i><i>The Giants win the pennant...</i><i>and they\\'re going crazy, they\\'re going crazy!</i><i>And home!</i><i>I don\\'t believe it!</i><i>I do not believe it!</i><i>The Giants won it by a score of 5 to 4...</i><i>and they\\'re picking Bobby Thomson upÂ\\x93</i><i>and carrying him off the field!</i>That\\'s what gave me my dream.Now the big dream,\\nof course, was to announce for the Giants.D-Did you?No. But--.Y-You still might?You never know.C-C-Can I h-hear it again?Sure.<i>Bobby Thomson\\nup there swinging.</i><i>He \\'5 had two out of three,</i><i>a single and a double,\\nand Billy Cox is playing--</i>Honey, we\\'re going to play a\\ngame.

Show her your legs, boys.That\\'s great!And guess what? I ordered\\nChineseÂ\\x93 I mean, Pan Asian, for dinner.Noodles!All right, go upstairs and change.When you come down,\\nwe\\'re going to arm-wrestle Grandma.How come we just had one?- It\\'s not too late.\\n- Oh!It\\'s really late.

Carl is dead!What? No! I killed Carl?Oh, honey, he\\'s fine. He\\'s just dazed.Yeah, yeah. Carl, you\\'re okay, aren\\'t you?Yeah, I\\'m all right, mate. I\\'m all right!- That wasn\\'t Carl, that was you!\\n- Shut up!No, he\\'s not all right!He\\'s dead! He\\'s mushed all over the road.His head is here and his body\\'s over there!It\\'s your fault! You made me get\\ninto a fight with him!We are so past weird.I love Carl!I even pack extra fortune cookies for him!Excuse me, what\\'s Chinese for mental case?Hello?We were cruising\\nand heard the alarm. ls everyone okay?Yes.No, he\\'s dead! The car killed him!He came out of nowhere!Officer, you\\'re wasting your time.What happened? Why are the police here?Why is the alarm on?- Oh, hi!\\n- Mommy!- Was there a break-in?\\n- It\\'s nothing.It\\'s absolutely nothing.\\nWhat are you doing home?I killed Carl!- What?\\n- You killed Carl? How?Who is Carl? Is he a family member?- Yes!\\n- No!He\\'s a kangaroo!He\\'s a what?Turner, your eye!How did that happen?Artie did it?Oh, no, no, no. lvan\\'s sister did it. I did that.You hit Mom?It was an accident!Ma\\'am, would you like to file a complaint?No!We were playing a game.That\\'s the dress.Does she have make-up on?Don\\'t growl at us.This is unbelievable.We leave and she\\'s 12,\\nwe come home and she\\'s 16.Boys, go in the house.Turner, turn off the alarm, please.You know, you\\'re not supposed\\nto be back until tomorrow.Well, we were just so curious...as to why Barker was nearly\\nkilled this morning at the X Games!Uh-oh! Get your taser ready.That\\'s not right.Barker was at a play date\\nthis morning with Artie.Oh. yeah?I was in a little bind...and I had to take him\\nwith me on some business.What business did you have\\nat the X Games?Yeah, Artie, what business?Um...Aren\\'t we forgetting\\nthe most serious issue here?What issue?The death of an imaginary kangaroo.He\\'s imaginary?Yes!You can go.Would someone please explain\\nwhat happened to Carl?We were playing Kick the Can...and it started to rain,\\nso we all came indoors...and I was helping\\nHarper get dressed for her party.A party? You\\'re throwing a party?No, Dad, I\\'m going to a party.No, Dad, I\\'m going to a party.For a boy who likes her.A boy? What boy?The night before your audition?\\nAre you kidding?I told her she could go.It\\'s ridiculous. It is out of the question.Maybe it\\'s ridiculous for me to spendall my time practicing the violin...never doing anything else\\nand auditioning for a school tomorrow...where I\\'m never going to do anything elsethe whole rest of my life.Huh?Well, she\\'s using her words.Harper. Harper!\\nI cannot allow you to take a talent...a gift to which you have\\ndedicated so much time and effort...and throw it away on a whim.I hate you and I wish\\nanyone else was my mother!Maybe not those words.Thanks, Mom and Dad.I couldn\\'t have\\ngotten through the week without you.I say we head for the airport right now.Don\\'t even take our clothes\\nwe just skedaddle.I followed you for 35 years, Artie.Wherever you needed to be,\\nthat\\'s where I was.No complaints.Well, some.But this week...This week was supposed to be about\\nus and our grandchildren.Not you.Not you.Did you have to go to that audition?It\\'s not one of my better moments.For one wonderful hour...we weren\\'t the \"other\" grandparents.Oh.There you are.You okay?I\\'ve had better Mommy days.You know, it may not have been\\nhorrible to let her go to that party.I know.I just walked into that scene and I freaked.I can\\'t believe my parents killed Carl.Well, I was thinking about that.You know, they didn\\'t kill\\nCarl, only Barker could do that.And it somehow took us\\nnot being here for him to do it.So, what\\'s your point?Maybe we coddle him too much.Maybe he needed a little tough love...to let go of his imaginary friend.But, Phil, that would make my father right.Yeah. We can\\'t have any of that.Harper?I could come back.No, no, no, it\\'s okay.I\\'m going to check on Barker.Thanks, Phil.I\\'m sorry.For what?Narrow it down for me, Dad.For this week.For almost getting Barker hurt today.I just feel terrible about that.What were you even doing there?I was on an audition.Because the Grizzlies fired me.What?Why didn\\'t you tell us?Because it\\'s humiliating.Why would they do that?You\\'re so good at that job.Maybe not good enough.Alice...your mom was really hoping...that this trip would help bring\\nher closer to her grandchildren.And she and Harper have developeda relationship that\\'s kind of great...and I don\\'t want\\nto see that end just because I screwed up.- What about you?\\n- Hmm?Don\\'t you want a relationship\\nwith your grandchildren?Of course I do.I mean...like an hour\\nbefore you came home, it was really good.It\\'s just that sometimes...I don\\'t feel...What?...welcome, here.What happened to us, Dad?How old were you when Harper was born?- Twenty-six.\\n- Mmm-hmm.Did you know what you were doing?No.I was 23 when you came along.And I was terrified, because you didn\\'t\\ncome with any instructions.And I thought I was doing okay.Because unlike my father,\\nI wasn\\'t constantly telling you...what an annoying little waste\\nof time you were...and believe me, I\\'m cleaning that up.And I thought that we were\\nactually having fun.Me and the weather girl...and the cutest little girl you ever saw,\\ntraveling around the country.But then years go by,\\nand your daughter goes off to college...and she doesn\\'t come home\\nfor Thanksgiving or Christmas.Or summers.Or ever.And you get these clues, this inkling...that perhaps all those years\\nshe wasn\\'t having such a good time...and that maybe she thought\\nyou didn\\'t do such a good job.And that really hurts. Doesn\\'t it?Yes.So, little girl,\\nI have to give you three put-ups.- No, Dad.\\n- Please.It\\'s okay.Harper, Turner, Barker.They\\'re great kids\\nand you\\'re a really good mother.Yeah.I\\'m basking in the glow\\nof my children\\'s affection.Harper? She didn\\'t mean anything.I mean, she\\'s 12.Get ready, it\\'s going to get a lot worse.Only, don\\'t let her turn her back on you.Because that will break your heart.Harper?No. Um...Barker has a special request\\nfor tomorrow, before the audition.And it involves all of us.Carl, your two favorite things were milk\\nand tofu dogs.Now, you can have both forever.Grandma, thanks for decorating the box.Oh, honey, it was my pleasure.Um,Carl...Can Artie say something nice for Carl?Me?How do you--.I\\'m sorry, Carl.He died so young.Mmm.How do you say goodbye\\nto somebody you could never say hello to?It\\'s hard.I didn\\'t get to see Carl very often,but then again, nobody else did.Except for Barker...which is what made him so special.Carl wasn\\'t just Barker\\'s friend,\\nhe was a part of him.And that made him a part of all of us.Carl, you will forever be in our hearts.Keep on hopping, buddy.Okay.Alice, you take Harper backstage.\\nWe\\'ll grab some seats.Barker, Turner, you\\'re with us.- Good luck.\\n- Knock them dead.Thanks.Break a leg.Bye, Dad.Don\\'t applaud. That\\'s that woman!<i>Good evening.</i><i>Welcome family, friends\\nand distinguished judges...</i><i>to the Atlanta Performing Arts Center.</i><i>I am Doctor Sch veer.</i><i>We have 74 amazingly talented musicians...</i><i>all vying for one position\\nat this prestigious conservatory.</i><i>So, without further ado I give you</i><i>Chet Halloran on the saxophone</i>Yeah! Go Chet!Hang on a second, honey.You know,\\nwhen you were just five years old...we took you to that\\nlittle music school for the first time.And all the other kids\\nthey were just banging on things.One kid tried to play another kid.But from that very first day, you played.And not just played...you had this look\\nof such fulfillment on your face.And I said to your dad, \"Whatever it takes...\"whatever we have to do, I always\"want to see that look on her face.\"Lately, I\\'m not seeing it.So, honey, do you\\nreally not want to switch schools again?Okay.What do you say we ditch this audition?Really?Yeah. It\\'s okay.Mommy, I didn\\'t mean what I said.Oh, baby.I wouldn\\'t want anyone else to be my mom.And I love you.That\\'s good\\nbecause you\\'re my only daughter.And you know,\\nI don\\'t really understand the boys.I know. How weird are they?Yeah, yeah!Hi, baby.We regret to inform you\\nof a slight change in our program.Harper Simmons has forfeited her slot...and her future.Since the next performer is warming up...we\\'re going to have to take\\na 10 minute break.Hey. what\\'s going on?She\\'s not going to audition.You\\'re not disappointed in me, are you?Oh, no, no, no. That\\'s not even a possibility.Is this is all my fault? It is, isn\\'t it?I came 3,000 miles\\nto ruin my granddaughter\\'s life.It\\'s not your fault.- Really?\\n- It was our choice.I love you.Here, take my picture, Phil.- Get in there.Uh, where\\'s Turner?You! Kid!Turner!<i>Bobby Thomson, up there swinging.</i><i>He\\'s had two out of three,\\na single and a double...</i><i>and Billy Cox is playing him\\nright an the third base line.</i><i>One out, last of the ninth.

Yeah!Wow.I saw it. I saw it, Artie.Call me Grandpa.My big boy. How on earth...?Grandpa taught me.Oh...Your father was wrong.So was yours.Oh, Al.How much would it\\nembarrass you if l kissed you right now?I think a lot.As soon as we get home.Okay, I look forward to it.Dr. Schveer, I shun you.You are shunned.My friends, it\\'s taken me over 35 years\\nto say these words...it\\'s opening day for the Giantsand we\\'ve got a capacity crowd.Giants are out in the field.\\nThere\\'s Charlie \"The Naz\" Naznic...batting .290, takes his stance at the plate.Yes, Art. Let\\'s see\\nif Naz can get his team out of a jam.Okay, Turner, here\\'s the action.Naz swings!He gets some wood on that one!Hard drive to Barker Simmons.Ooh! It\\'s through his legs.Walters has it. No, Walters loses it.Sherman\\'s got a glove down.\\nNo, he stopped to pick his nose.Now, Douglas is sitting down\\nand taking off his shoes...because his mom said to me\\nbefore the game...\"Sometimes he\\'s in another world.\"Sherman still working\\non that thing in his nose.Man, that must be really packed in there!You betcha!Naz rounds second, heads for third.Sherman has the booger!\\nSherman has the booger!I don\\'t believe it! I do not believe it!The other players are coming over\\nto examine it.I can see it from here!Wow, you could take\\nan aerial photograph of that thing!I\\'m sure there\\'s going\\nto be orange slices in the locker room...and a couple of tissues.Meanwhile, Naz scores.\\nAnd that is another home run!The Giants are still leading, 34 to 27.What a first inning!You\\'re telling me.I hope the second inning is shorterbecause grandpa needs a bathroom break.- Whoo!\\n- Go Barker!Our next batter is coming\\nup to the plate.He\\'s number three, Barker Simmons.Yeah, Barker!Young man with incredible\\npower. Three-foot-four and 45 pounds.He hits it to shortstop. Oh, it\\'s through!Barker heading towards first base.No, he makes a right turn!He makes a right turn.Barker, go back!He\\'s going the wrong way.What are you doing here?I just wanted to say hi.He just wanted to say hi.Well, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever heard--Turn around, everybody. Take our picture.Okay, picture.<i>{got to\\ntell you friends, this is one of those days</i><i>Seventy-eight degrees,\\nthe sold out crowd of 56\\' fans...</i><i>the smell of the popcorn, the hot dogsÂ\\x93</i><i>the loud pushy parents, and the crying kids.</i><i>But I\\'ll tell you something,\\nthere\\'s no other place I\\'d rather be.</i><i>Andes my grandson Barker\\nsaid to me this morning...</i><i>\"Man, your feet smell like cheese. \"</i><i>This is Artie Decker,\\nDe Voice of the Peewee Giants..</i><i>saying see you next game!</i>And, lights out, Alice.<i>Settle dawn,\\nit\\'ll all be clear</i><i>Don \\'1\\' pay no mind\\nto the demons</i><i>They fill you with fear</i><i>The trouble, it might drag you down</i><i>If you get lost, you can always be found</i><i>Just know you\\'re not alone</i><i>\\'Cause I\\'m going to make\\nthis place your home</i>Um...\\nAndy?

I thought\\nyou were covering politics now.Well, I\\'m multi-talented.How come she was arrested here if she\\'s been\\na Vermont housewife for thirty years?You\\'ll have to ask her that.You know, it\\'s funny you should mention it, Dee\\'cause from what I hear people give\\njailhouse interviews all the time.Who do you think you are,\\nThe New York Times?You say New York Times like it\\'s 1985\\nand you\\'re still impressed.You\\'re just a local beat reporter.\\n- I love it when you do that with your hair.This is a national news story,\\nI think you should go home and tweet about it.I don\\'t tweet.\\n- Right!

Here?\\n- Yeah.Hello!Billy Cusimano?My name\\'s Ben Shepard,\\nfrom the Albany Sun-Times,I wanted to ask you a few questions\\nabout the Sharon Solarz arrest?You can, but why would I comment about that?\\n- Well, you know her, don\\'t you?No, I don\\'t.Quick search of police records shows you\\nand Sharon together in Mendocino in 1971.I\\'ve never been to Mendocino.That\\'s not true, is it? You were dealing hash there\\nfor an outfit called the Brotherhood of Eternal Love.Which is a great name, by the way.Sharon been in touch recently?Look, I know she called\\nyou prior to her arrest.You talked to Jim Grant.\\n- No, I talked to the FBI, who\\'s Jim Grant?Who is the FBI?\\n- Well, they had you on a wiretap here for a while,so it seems you\\'re growin\\' somethin\\' more\\nthan tomatoes and potatoes here, Billy.Shit. That\\'s why I pay taxes, right?\\nSo Big Brother can... hack my fuckin\\' phone!Who\\'s Jim Grant?\\n- He\\'s a lawyer, man.Lawyer? Sharon\\'s?\\n- Nah, he wouldn\\'t take the case.Look, kid...Sharon called me wanting to turn herself in...\\n- Turn herself in?Nope, I\\'m not saying anything else.\\nEverything here is off the record.Ah, see... it doesn\\'t work that way. You gotta say\\n\"off the record\" before we have the conversation.Who says?\\n- Those are the rules.There\\'s rules for what you people do, huh?So, what did she say?\\n- She said that I did greatand that she was very impressed.What\\'d I tell you?Yeah?\\n- Hi... uh, is this Mr. Grant?This is Ben Shepherd from the Albany Sun-Times?\\n- Oh... yes.<i>Just wondering if you care to comment\\non the Sharon Solarz arrest?</i>- What?\\n- The Sharon Solarz arrest, you declined to take her case...Yeah, you know... I\\'m just sitting down to dinner right now.\\nI gotta call you back, okay?Uh, sir... I ju...As the turbulent decade drew to a closethe Students for a Democratic Society,the leading student group\\nopposed to the war in Vietnam,had its power usurped by a more militant faction,\\nknown as the Weather Underground Organization.Frustrated with years\\nof non-violent proteststhat had failed to end the war,the so-called \"Weathermen\" decided the best\\nway to stop America\\'s involvement in Vietnamwas to bring the war home.The Weathermen radicalized the anti-war movement,and carried out a series of bombings\\nagainst government institutions includingbombing the Pentagon, the U.S. Capitol,\\nand the State Department.No group has been more successful\\nin carrying out attacks on U.S. soil.What\\'s wrong?\\n- Nothin\\'.You look weird.\\n- I\\'m fine, honey.You\\'re lying.\\n- I\\'m not lying...You are lying, because you\\'re smiling.I\\'m not smiling.\\n- \"I\\'m not smiling.\"Well maybe I\\'m happy?\\nHere. Come on, eat.And then get ready.Hey!\\n- Hey.- You Jim Grant, by chance?\\n- Not by chance.Would you follow up on those\\ncounter-signatures from Roger?Yep.I\\'m Ben Shepherd, Albany Sun-Times, we spoke on the phone.\\nI just figured I\\'d come by and say hi...I don\\'t really have anything to say...\\nOh, and Susan, would you pull out the Rochester files for...?You don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna ask you yet.\\n- ..the report for my deposition? Do what?I said you don\\'t know what I\\'m gonna ask you yet.Well, you\\'re a reporter.Well, I could just put \"Refused\\nto answer any questions.\"What?\\n- I\\'m just doing a little background, sir.Okay.\\n- Thank you! (Thank you.)No, no... we\\'re off the record here.Which part?\\n- All of it...whatever it is we\\'re gonna be talking about here,\\notherwise, you can leave now.No, that\\'s fine.\\nIt\\'s not important.So, did Sharon Solarz contact you\\nprior to her arrest?Does it matter?\\nSince you already printed that she did?Actually, what was printed was that she may have approached\\na public-interest lawyer who declined to take the case.But your name was never mentioned.There are 25 lawyers in the area.Nine do criminal,\\nsix do accidents,five do deeds, and four do closings...\\nand then there\\'s me.I wasn\\'t insinuating...\\n- The hell with accuracy, huh?Be vague, be accusatory, and whatever sticks? Is that how it works?\\n- Nothing I wrote was false.You made it seem like I was\\nharboring a known fugitive.We can issue a correction.\\n- Sharon Solarz... did not contact me,and I have no involvement in her case.Really?\\n- Really.Do you know she\\'s now being represented\\nby a Margaret Hart in Philadelphia?Right.\\n- Ms. Hart was a classmate of yours in law school?Mm-hmm.Lawyers know each other,\\nthat\\'s news?Yeah, but you did refer Ms. Hart\\nas counsel, didn\\'t you?Says who?\\n- Ms. Hart herself, this morning.Maggie Hart is one of the best\\ndefense lawyers in the country.But why pass this off? I mean,\\nthat\\'s what doesn\\'t make sense to me.Cases like this don\\'t come around very often,\\nI\\'m sure I don\\'t have to tell you that.\\'Cause Sharon Solarz deserves a\\nbetter defense than I can provide.Deserves? That\\'s\\nan interesting word choice.You know, it may seem untrue to you,\\nbut we do live in a free countryand people are entitled to\\na decent defense.Now look, I got work to do.You\\'ve handled First Amendment cases,labor cases, you worked\\nhand-in-glove with the ACLU...I mean, this is right in\\nyour wheelhouse, isn\\'t it?Is this what you came here to talk about?\\n- I\\'m not sure yet.Well, that pretty well sums up why journalism\\nis dead. Now, do you mind?Why did Billy Cusimano come to you?\\n- I don\\'t know.Well, how well do you\\nknow Billy Cusimano?- I don\\'t, really.I mean... you do, really.\\nYou represented him a few years back,on a drug case, you got him off.\\n- I represent a lot of people, Jesus...Mist... Look, I\\'m not trying to offend you, Mr. Grant, I\\'m...Oh, I\\'m not offended. You\\'re\\npretty much exactly what I expected.Susan, I\\'ll call you from the car.Sir...Mr. Grant... look, I\\'m just trying to put the pieces together.\\n- Hey. Look, look... Listen...I didn\\'t take the case because I\\'m a\\nsingle parent with a private practiceand too much on my plate, alright?If I could have helped, I would\\'ve.Because you are sympathetic to their cause?\\nYou agree with her tactics?You know, clearly you have\\nsome kind of an agenda here,I don\\'t have time for this bullshit.\\n- I don\\'t, actually...I don\\'t care much for either side.So, what? That makes you fair and balanced?You know... it\\'s a funny thing. Thirty years ago, a smart guy\\nlike you probably would\\'ve been involved with the movement yourself.I hope you get what you\\'re\\nlooking for, kid. Take care.Thank youHold one sec\\'... hang on.Thank you for doing this.\\n- No worries, mate. I got you.Thank you.Hey, guys!Sorry I\\'m late.\\n- Not a problem, we\\'re having fun.You do your homework?\\n- Of course.Ah, good...\\nThank you.I\\'m the one who did it.- Oh, ooh... well, thank you.She\\'s getting better every day.\\n- Yeah...Hey.I\\'m sorry, can you walk me through that research, please?\\n- Yeah.Thank you.It\\'s... uh, all basic stuff,He was, uh, born in Bakersfield, California...\\nattended Iowa State University,University of Virginia Law...\\nuh, met his wife while working at the... Planet... Earth...Earth First Foundation?\\n- Yeah...and came up here,\\nstarted his own practice.This his wife?\\nWhat happened to her?Car accident. 48-years-old.Wow... that\\'s horrible.Yeah, you meet a younger woman, you have a kid...\\nshe\\'s not supposed to die on ya\\'...supposed to meet a car salesman\\nand move to Vegas, like mine did.Anything else?\\n- Umm... house is paid for,he\\'s obviously a responsible single parent...pillar of society, do-gooder...\\nlot of pro bono work...Right. So basically, nothing I can\\nturn into a story. Great.Hello, Dan?I can not believe you\\'re calling me!I know.\\n- This is a goddamn nightmare...Dan...\\n- I don\\'t want anything to do with this.Dan, you\\'re my brother.\\nI need your help.Go ahead.Ray, who\\'s your best reporter?Mansfield.\\n- Mansfield?Bullshit.Please, have a seat.\\n- Look...So, at first I think Grant is trying to\\nlink up with the others,help negotiate a deal, bring them in,\\nlike Solarz tried.Yeah, well... that would make a good story.\\n- It gets so much better...So I go and I look at the man\\'s history,right, see if he has any known\\nassociations to the Weathermen.Nothing.\\n- So?Nothing on the man at all...\\nthe man doesn\\'t exist before 1979.Look at this...I had it wrong, Ray.\\nHe\\'s dead.Jim Grant is not trying to represent\\nMimi Lurie or Nick Sloan.Jim Grant is Nick Sloan.I\\'m tired.\\n- I know, sweetheart, but we have to get an early start.For school?\\n- No, we\\'re not going to school.Then where are we going?\\n- Well, we\\'re gonna go on a little trip.A trip?\\n- Uh-huh.Breaking news this morning\\nfrom the Albany Sun-Timesreporting former seventies radical fugitive\\nNicholas Sloan has been discovered in Albany,living as a lawyer\\nnamed James Grant.Sloan is wanted for murder, and has been\\non the run for more than thirty years.Alright people, what do we have on Grant?His EasyPass paid a toll at 4 this morning\\non I-87, heading north,ah, the border\\'s already been alerted.We have an agent talking to his secretary.\\n- Why don\\'t we have a better picture of Grant?We\\'re working on it.\\n- Well, what about from his house?Just waiting on the warrant.Their bodies are so bendy.Do you know this one\\'s name?Border security cams are still being\\nchecked, there\\'s no matches yet.Does Grant have any family?\\n- A daughter, 11.Is she with him?

I got a pet seal,well, not pet seal,\\nbut a little seal doll.And does it... did you give it a name?I named her Harper.Harper? Why Harper?\\n- Yeah... \\'Cause it\\'s a harbor seal...Har-bor.\\n- Yeah. So it\\'s Harper. Harbor. Harper. Harbor.Oh, I get the connection.\\nSo, right... well where is it? Where\\'s Harper?Hmmm... not there.Somethin\\' you should love you\\nshould keep close to, you know?We\\'re disappointed in you.\\n- Hah! You\\'re disappointed in me!Daniel Sloan is on the move,\\nwe\\'re tracking him.See you soon.Daniel Sloan has stopped at\\nthe Rosewood Hotel.We\\'re keeping a safe distance.You two canvas the stairs.You take the elevators.Hey, what\\'s that noise?It\\'s a goddamn fire alarm.Okay, lock down the building now,\\nno one goes in or out.Not if there\\'s a fire.Daddy? Dad!Come on!Okay, what the hell is happening?\\n- They\\'re evacuating the building.Shit!  It\\'s a diversion!Contact the local police and fire department,notify them that we have a dangerous fugitive,send them a description of Nicholas Sloan.Alright, what do we have on the brother, and where is he?\\n- I have no idea...and the place is completely jammed,\\nand there\\'s too many people...

You come with me.\\nEyes on the crowd.Subway! Woods,\\nlet\\'s check the subway.Nothin\\' here.\\n- Let\\'s go.Sir, we can\\'t find him.\\n- Come on, people.Sir, how long have you been in contact with Nicholas Sloan?\\n- No comment.Is that his daughter?\\n- No comment! I wanna get her home.Fugitive terrorist Nicholas Sloan had apparently\\nbeen practicing law in Albany for three decades,under the name James Grant, before he was exposed\\nrecently by a reporter from the Albany Sun-Times.This shit should already be over.\\nWe need better intel.We\\'ve grilled the brother.Have we gotten anything out of Sharon Solarz?\\n- No, she\\'s refusing to talk.She\\'ll talk to the local reporter,\\nshe\\'s already said.Well, what do we know about him?\\n- He\\'s... nothing reporter, local.Okay... let\\'s get him in.Can you try and pull it together?\\n- Of course.I\\'m serious. Cornelius is already pissed.\\n- Yeah.Hello there.\\n- I\\'m Special Agent Cornelius, you must be Shepherd.Yep.The prisoner is considered dangerous,\\nyou do not accept anything from her.No letters, packages, or messages of any kind.\\nYour time starts now.Hello.\\n- Wow, you\\'re much younger than I thought you\\'d be.Well, that\\'s always nice to hear.I didn\\'t mean it as a compliment.Well... still, thank you.\\n- You did me a favor when you wrote that article.I wouldn\\'t mistake it for sympathy.No... just clarity.Yeah... clarity.\\nSo, let\\'s talk clarity.Okay.You were on your way to\\nNew York to turn yourself in?How does Billy Cusimano fit in?\\n- Billy\\'s my friend, and he did nothing but encourage me to...turn myself in if I thought that\\nthat would bring me peace.Mmm... you know his phone was tapped?\\n- Yeah. They got lucky.And you got unlucky.\\n- Yeah.Why now, after thirty years?You don\\'t have kids, do you?\\n- No, I... I barely have furniture.Well, if you do, you\\nrealize that they change you.I have two, a boy and a girl...\\n- Mm-hmm.and I waited until I thought they were\\nold enough to be able to handle it,but still young enough that... I can...So was it a crisis of conscience?Hmm?Remorse for past transgressions\\nthat became intolerable?The past thirty years in a sentence! Ha.Wow, it must be nice to see\\nthe world so cleanly.Didn\\'t you once?Most of us led very sheltered lives,\\nwe had no real relationship with violence.But at that time, all these...\\nkids were... taking to the streetsin, uh, Japan, and France, China, Angola,There was revolution, and I\\nwanted to be part of it.Sure! Sounds groovy.You think we were all just a...\\nbunch of doped up hippies running around.It was hardly groovy,our government was murdering millions,\\nand we could see...horrifying images, on the news... magazines,My Lai, Selma...made us crazy, we didn\\'t know what to do, we...we, uh, protested, we sat in, we got our sculls crackedand the war just kept escalating.And then there was Kent State, and Jackson State, and...kids our age... were being murdered\\nby our government... on campuses.It\\'s not our finest hour.\\n- It wasn\\'t abstract, there was a draft.You would\\'ve gotten a number, and then...\\nall you could do is just wait.And everybody knew somebody that was going over,\\nor somebody who was not coming back.You never get over that.\\n- Apparently not.It sounds to me like justification,I find it hard to believe that the only\\noption available to you at the time was violence.Well, we thought that sitting at home while your government\\ncommitted genocide and doing nothing about it, that that was violence.What about you?What are you willing to take a risk for?I don\\'t know. I know that I wouldn\\'t\\nblow up a building. I wouldn\\'t kill anybody for anything.Yeah, well... dissent can be dicey.But you can\\'t get to my age\\nwithout some regrets.Would you do it again?If... I didn\\'t have kids,\\nand old parents that I love,Yeah, I would do it again.Smarter, better... different.But I\\'d do it, yeah.We made mistakes,\\nbut we were right.Hmm... and is Nick Sloan right?He has a daughter much younger than yours,\\nthat he abandoned in a hotel room.People do what they have to do.\\n- Well, what are you doing then, herewith me? I mean, you...\\nyou had a choice in all this after all.Well, look at me. It doesn\\'t matter what I say, unless...\\nI say it to somebody who\\'s interested in the truth.And it seems, as if you\\'re interested in the truth.\\nMost people aren\\'t.What are you gonna do?\\n- My job.Good.And what do you think Jim... Nick...\\nwhat do you think he\\'s doing now?Maybe you should figure that out.\\n- Hmm.Look, if my coming here in\\nany way was responsible for...him being found out, well that\\nwas not my intention, and he knows that.We never betrayed each other,\\nnot once, any of us, over all these years,and I\\'m not about to start now.What about Mimi Lurie?Is she out there living a good, clean, productive life?\\n- Anything\\'s possible.Mimi and Nick...were different.Radicals? Yes.\\nBut also lovers.Did you ...\\n- Time\\'s up, sir.Thank you for talking to me.\\n- Thank you for listening.They did unforgivable things,\\nbut you gotta appreciate the commitment.No, you don\\'t. Appreciate the fact that the\\nbank guard they murdered had two small kids.It\\'s just hard to reconcile the woman with her past.Sir, don\\'t allow yourself to get spun by these people\\n- I don\\'t \"get spun.\"Well, you\\'ve been pretty soft on her\\nfrom the very beginning.We\\'re the good guys here,\\nbut you seem not to care.You write an article that blasts my team\\npublicly for doing our jobs well,and you make light of decent...\\n- No. No, I didn\\'t blast anybody. She was turning herself in, that\\'s her...No! There was no deal. We had intel,\\nwe tracked her, we made the arrest. Now...Where\\'s that article? We took a\\nthirty-year fugitive off the street,and would have gotten her partner if it\\nhadn\\'t been for some two-bit journalist interfering...Would you even know who he was,\\nif it wasn\\'t for me?Well, you do seem awfully tied in to these people,Solarz only talks to you, you meet with\\nSloan two days before he disappears,Givin\\' him a big head-start, if not more...Perhaps you\\'re a little more interesting\\nthan I initially thought?We\\'re bringing these people down,\\nand I hope I don\\'t find you in my way.Agent, I need you to report to an OPR review.Don\\'t ever ask me for anything again.What are you talking about? I thought we were bonding?\\n- I feel like I just watched you get hypnotised in there...\"I was just young, female, and opposing injustice\"?\\nThat\\'s her justification? That was offensive!I\\'m not arguing that point...Where are you guys on the Sloan thing?\\nYou think you\\'re gonna find him?I think he knows how to run,\\nwhich means he has an advantage.Terrorists justify terrorism, Ben.\\nDon\\'t get confused here.Don\\'t tell me you have to go\\nwhen you don\\'t have to go!- Hello?\\n- This is Ben Shepherd, Albany Sun-Times.- Yes?- Dr. Sloan, I\\'ve spoken directly to your\\nbrother. I\\'ve spoken to Sharon Solarz...Yes?\\n- I have something to tell you, sir...it\\'s important that we speak.\\n- Go ahead... be quick.Two minutes, but not over the phone.\\nI don\\'t trust phones... yours or mine, for that matter.You get here before ten.\\n- Perfect! Thank you, sir.Yes, we are currently outside the home of Dr. Daniel Sloan,\\nbrother of fugitive Nick Sloan.We have no new information to report at this time,\\nbut we are continuing to monitor the situation...Ben Shepherd.\\n-Yeah?Albany Sun-Times.\\n-Yeah...Maulik Banjali of Reuters...\\n- Hey! What\\'s goin\\' on?No interviews.No interviews?\\n- Yeah.Hi, uh... Ben Shepard, Albany Sun-Times,Dr. Sloan\\'s expecting to see me?\\n- Yes, he is, sir. You can go right up.Thank you.Dr. Sloan, Ben Shepard. I\\'m sorry I\\'m late.\\n- Ah, yeah...Thank you.Beautiful...So, uh... tell me what you need to tell me.W... uh... We sh...\\nOkay, um...Well, your brother obviously counted on you a great deal...Were you two close growing up?\\n- He was my older brother,I looked up to him. I was a kid,\\nI didn\\'t understand what he was doing.You said you had something to tell me.\\n- I\\'m just trying to figure out why you\\'re helping him?Well, I\\'m helping my niece,\\nshe\\'s innocent in all this.And your brother?They blew up buildings.\\nIt\\'s been well-documented.Do you approve of that?\\n- Of course not.Now, if you have nothing more to ask, I think that...\\n- Do you think he\\'s coming back for his daughter?Is that what he\\'s doing?\\n- Excuse me?I\\'m trying to understand his thinking process.\\nI mean, why not take his daughter with him?You know, why not change his name and disappear?\\nHe obviously knows how to do that.You said you had something to tell me.\\nObviously, that\\'s not the case.So, I think we\\'re done here.\\nWe didn\\'t ask for this.I don\\'t condone what he did...and I certainly don\\'t appreciate you\\nmanipulating your way into my house.You need to leave.\\n- Are you enrolling her in school?\\'Cause I tell you, this situation doesn\\'t\\nlook like a permanent situation to me,and I\\'m guessing not to you either.So, what is he doin\\'?Buying himself time for something.\\n- I dunno, for what?I don\\'t know, I\\'m asking you.Your brother\\'s nothing if he\\'s not logical.\\nAnd right now, nothing he\\'s doing...makes any sense if he\\'s guilty.Help yourself...You know... you should...\\nHoly shit!It\\'s right over here, lumber yard.Don\\'t worry, nobody\\'s watching.They\\'re on Daniel.\\nThey\\'ll get to you, soon enough.Yeah, well... anyone works for me\\nis an ex-con anyway.Boy, this is some operation you got here.\\n- Yeah...Yeah... ya\\' got redwood, ya\\' got\\npine, and cedar in there...Western Red Cedar... you can smell it.\\nIt\\'s a fire meth(?) and certified.Yeah, I can see you\\'re still into\\nherbal teas and soy products.Yeah, well, you know...

How do you know that?Because of the name she lived under\\nbefore she married her current husband.It was in the papers\\nwhen she was arrested,Coyle. And that was you\\nwhen you went under in \\'72.I figured you got married and...\\ngave her a new identity, and thenshe went somewhere else, and then after a couple of\\nyears you gave an uncontested divorce,and left her with a name.Right? Am I right?Did Mimi come to you, too?\\n- Well now, why would Mimi come to me?You know, I\\'m...\\nShit, man, this is a real shit-kicker of a questionin\\'...and to show up and ask me to trust you with information\\nthat makes me an accessory to murder?Neither of them had any fuckin\\' right to\\nask me a thing... and neither do you.I mean, I was a-wind of you guys for the B and M, and\\nI wasn\\'t even on a damn committee!I was the fuck out of it, and...\\n- Did she come to you, or not?Alright... alright...\\n- Just tell me, for christ\\'s sake.You know better than anyone... Mimi was not\\ngoing to be some kind of suburban housewife,drive a min-van\\nand go to the PTA!She was gonna live or die a freedom fighter!...married to the movement.

As long as bankrupting people\\'s\\npension funds remains legit,And running good, honest weed remains... criminal?You\\'re gonna wanna look at that.\\nI saved it for ya\\'.Sharon Solarz... a housewife in Vermont, do you believe it?\\n- Shit.And Billy Cusimano...Who?\\n- From the Brotherhood.Nice to know ol\\' Billy\\'s\\nkeeping the flame alive.And Nick Sloan... a lawyer from Albany.\\nChrist, how\\'d he manage to pull that one off?It\\'s what he always wanted.As I recall, you two were pretty tight.I don\\'t know, it was a long time ago.So, why do you think she decided to\\nturn herself in after all these years?I don\\'t know, Mac.Guess she got tired.\\n- Yeah.Times change, babe.Tabs, maybe.Mr. McGowan, this is Ben Shepard calling\\nagain from the Albany Sun-Times newspaper...uh, as I said, this is regarding the research that we\\'re\\ndoing on the Bank of Michigan robbery...and I would appreciate a call back,\\nuh, my number is 518-555-1218.Hello?You\\'re not gonna believe what just happened to me.\\nFBI was in my apartment.I don\\'t need this right now.\\n- Look, a search warrant. No probable cause, that\\'s a story, right?That\\'s not a story.\\n- They\\'re pissed because I\\'m doing their job better than they are.Well, you know how to make friends, don\\'t you?\\n- It\\'s not about making friends! It\\'s about making history!I\\'m talkin\\' about history...- I got your request...I can\\'t send you to Michigan.You have to send me to Michigan, she\\'s being indicted in Michigan.\\n- We\\'ll get it from the wires.No, wires are shit.

I\\'m on the\\n10-yard line and you\\'re stopping me right now.That\\'s a bad article.- It\\'s a bad arti... it\\'s an exclusive\\nwith the guy\\'s brother! It\\'s a bad article...You took a shot at him, you made it personal.He\\'s a shmuck, Ray!\\n- I don\\'t fucking care what he is!That\\'s not what we do!\\nAnd this is not the first time!You don\\'t just destroy someone to see\\nif you can uncover something!That\\'s a shitty way to go about things!\\nGot it?The fact that we are even having\\nthis conversation is ridiculous.I gave you an exclusive with Sharon Solarz,\\nI gave you an exclusive with the guy\\'s brother.Nick Sloan would still be defending spotted owls if it\\nwasn\\'t for me. Nobody can do what I am doing, Ray.Alan Springer, returning.\\n- I gotta call him back.I\\'m in this in a big way, I need support now, Ray.\\nI need you to support me.And you need to stop provoking people.\\nEspecially the FBI! Okay?Okay.I got bosses too, you know.So, what are you thinkin\\'?You know, I\\'m still wrapping my head around it.These people are... they\\'re all nuts,\\nbut none of \\'em are illogical.You know, if this man is trying to escape,\\nif he was trying to disappear,he\\'d have taken his daughter with him.Maybe.\\n- But he didn\\'t.Instead, he conducts a very risky and\\ncomplicated series of switches,gets his daughter in safekeeping,\\ngets to New York. By himself, alone.Which changes everything, right? I mean, if the guy is\\ninnocent, and he\\'s running because he\\'s innocent,why doesn\\'t Sharon just clear him?Because she\\'s in custody and she was his partner,\\nand that doesn\\'t hold up in court.Yeah, but why, why, why, why hide for thirty years\\nif you\\'re innocent, y\\' know?Innocence only gets you so far.Michigan number.\\nThis is where it all started!\\'Cause you\\'re not going to Michigan.\\n- Ben Shepherd.Mr. McGowan!\\nThank you for calling me b...Yes.

Can I give you my number,\\nand then maybe you can pass it to him?I\\'d really appreciate it, I\\'m quite harmless.\\n- Really?The number is 518-555-1218.That\\'s my office and I\\'m calling you from my cell.\\nThanks for your time.The manhunt for Nicholas Sloan continues\\nat this time in Milwaukeewhere former Weather Underground member\\nDonald Fitzgerald was taken into custody today.Federal authorities suspect Mr. Fitzgerald\\nof aiding and abetting Nicholas Sloanwho continues to elude Federal investigators.Nick went to Donal,\\nhe\\'s trying to find me.You\\'re safe here, you can lie low.You know I counted last night,I\\'ve walked out on six lives...Six sets of friends... six lovers...\\nsix homes, six names.....not including my own.So, you moving on again?\\n- Mm-hmm.You wanna take the boat?\\n- Uh-uh...

We remember that...\\nthere he is, Karl Marx.Now, these theories propose\\na history immune to effort,removed from the choices of everyday life.But history...\\nis made by human beings!And action... and passion...\\nno less than fate, or economics,are it\\'s essential ingredients.Go! Go, go go...\\nBut come back tomorrow!Because we\\'ll be discussing Fanon.Enjoyed your lecture.\\n- Thank you.\"Action and passion\"\\nsounds like something a friend of mine used to say.No...

You can\\nwalk me to class.Yeah?\\n- Mm-hmm.So, tell me about yourself.\\n- Peace Corp for a bit,thought I was gonna change the world,decided it was actually people\\nwho needed changing,went back to school to study psychology,\\nturns out psychology has nothing to do with that,ended up in New York, for a bit...I guess I thought I was gonna change myself,turns out I\\'m too stubborn.You must be older than I thought.So, what happens now?\\nIf in doubt, you go back to law school?I\\'m not in doubt.\\nIt\\'s my mom, she\\'s a judge.Really? So was mine!\\nJust not professionally.You like Michigan?I love it.Okay, you...I read one of your articles online last night.\\nI read a couple of them, actually.You\\'re kidding me? Really?\\nAnd what\\'d you think?I think you broke a big story.\\n- I did!I think you\\'re clinging to it like a life-raft.\\n- Oh, ho, ho.... wow.and now it defines you.\\n- Wow!Yeah, I do.\\n- Maybe psych\\'s not a bad fit after all.I kinda call \\'em like I see \\'em.Fair enough, call this one.\\nYour father\\'s ignoring me, why?I\\'m guessing because... he doesn\\'t want to talk to you?Hmm...\\n- He\\'s retired.I mean, and this was decades ago.\\nHe wants to fish, and watch boats on the water...He\\'s also not one for reminiscing.You know he was close to the Lurie family?Yeah. Her dad and my granddad\\nwere fishing buddies, I think.Yeah, so I heard.\\n- Yeah, they used to go up to the Linder Woods in the U.P.It\\'s absolutely gorgeous\\nup there, you would hate it.The \"U.P.\"?\\n- The upper peninsula.He told me he never met her.Huh!Had to be hard, live with the Lurie name\\nafter everything went down.Yeah. I\\'m sure it was.You ever talk about her\\nwhen you were younger?This was all way before my time.What are you thinking?Can I speak honestly with you for a second?\\n- Yeah.People lie for two reasons.They speak unknowingly, a simple mistake, y\\' know.\\nOr they do it intentionally,and having met a known fugitive who\\'s also\\na family friend isn\\'t something you would forget.Mm... what are you getting at?In my business, when someone lies\\nintentionally, that\\'s significant.It seems your father lied to me,\\nI\\'m guessing it\\'s some way to cover himself.Look, Ben, I get that you\\'re good\\nat your job, but so is my dad,and I would put the quality of his character\\nup against anyone in the world.So, if you\\'re insinuating that he was\\nor is somehow involved in somethingthat ends up in your paper? I would be damn sure\\nyou know what you\\'re talking about.I may be a student of the law, but that\\'s libel,and in my business, that\\'s significant.I\\'d like to see you again!Bye.Every sixth and seventh number.How do I know who I\\'m calling?\\n- You don\\'t.Okay.\\n- Good luck.Hi, this is, uh, John Smith,\\nI\\'m looking for a plumber.Are you now?\\n- Yes, I am.Wow, been a long time since I\\'ve heard that.\\n- Is this line clean?Babe, they didn\\'t listen to me back then,\\nand they sure ain\\'t listenin\\' to me now.Who\\'s calling?\\n- Nick Sloan.Nick Sloan? God, I just saw you on TV.\\n- Unless you wanna see yourself there too, we\\'d better hurry.I need to get to Mimi Lurie.Where are you?\\n- 845-555-8249.Okay, I\\'ll see if we still got the juice.Hang tight, brother.You wanna hear somethin\\' funny?\\nI\\'ve been Jim Grant longer than I\\'ve been me.That\\'s nice.Come on, Jed, we\\'re just talking here.We don\\'t need to talk.I think we do, you\\'re angry.\\n- You\\'re damn right I am.Jesus. Thirty years on, still holding a grudge, huh?No...it was the lack of respect.You guys put everybody in danger.\\nWe didn\\'t kill anybody, we didn\\'t hurt anyone.We were a peace movement,\\nfor christ\\'s sake!People make mistakes, Jed.Then you turn yourself in and\\natone for what you\\'ve done,and then you keep up the struggle\\nin any small way you can.You like what you\\'re doing now?Yeah.Yeah! I like what I try to do...\\nI like my students.Seems like it\\'s mutual.Yeah...

She\\'s probably never gonna\\nget over what\\'s happened to her already,and she\\'s got a whole life ahead of her.So, I\\'m asking you just to...\\n- You\\'re asking meto give myself up, so I can\\nclear you, for the sake of the child.I see... everything to protect\\nthe new little family.Fuck your principles, fuck anything\\nelse you used to stand for?Well, the struggle doesn\\'t end\\njust because you got tired of it.I didn\\'t get tired of it,\\nI grew up.We promised each other we weren\\'t going to do that.\\n- Yeah, but it happened.I left the movement for the same\\nreason I joined itbecause I didn\\'t want to see good people\\'s\\nlives thrown away for nothing.You\\'ve waited a long time\\nto tell me that, haven\\'t you?And you\\'ve been a long time\\ncoming home from the bank.You were close to Mimi Lurie\\'s family.I wouldn\\'t say close,\\nmy dad knew her dad.You went to the same school, same church,\\nyou went on fishing trips together.There\\'s something you\\'re not telling me.What are you driving at, Shepard?We know that Nick Sloan is looking\\nfor something or someone to clear him.I know that\\'s your assumption.\\n- Could that be Mimi Lurie?I\\'m off the record.Think it out. First he\\'d have to find\\nher, and convince her to testify.Second, she\\'d have to surrender.But it\\'s a participants testimony.\\n- That\\'s the point.If Mimi comes out of hiding, and surrenders herself\\nto testify that Nick Sloan wasn\\'t at the bank,it\\'s what lawyers call a declaration against interest.Destroys her own possibility of a defense.\\nIt would clear him.Why? Why would she do that? Why would she\\ngive herself up to a jail sentence to save him?I mean, what is her motivation?\\nYou really she\\'s gonna do that?Don\\'t matter what we think.He obviously believes he can convince her.\\n- Why now?Why not do this back then?How long have you known about this?I\\'m obviously not the only person in this conversationwho knows about her ties to a piece of\\nproperty just on the other side of Canada.Mr. Osborne, what\\'s the actual charge\\nagainst a law enforcement officer whofails to follow credible evidence about\\nthe whereabouts of a known fugitive?I think there\\'d be a variety, actually.You have information,\\nwhy aren\\'t you coming forward?Well, you have information too.\\nSo what are you gonna do?I\\'m a journalist.\\nI\\'m gonna do what I always do.And this information\\'s gonna be on\\nevery computer screen in the next 20 minutes,and I\\'m gonna find out everything\\nyou\\'re hiding from me,and I\\'m gonna expose it in a very big and very real way.You\\'re about to do a lot of damage\\nto a lot of people.You\\'ve no idea how much.I think they have it coming.\\n- On that, you could not be more wrong.Innocent people are about to get\\nswept up in this storm you\\'re unleashing.Trust me.\\n- Trust you...?Tell me something, Mr Osborne.Are you one of those innocent people?\\n- No, I am not.But my daughter is.How so?I got somethin\\' I need to do,but on my own terms.Upper peninsula.\\'Becc, it\\'s Dad.\\nI\\'m trying you again.Um... sorry about the messages.uh...Listen, if you... when you get a chance,\\nI need to talk to you, to tell you...this... Shepard guy, um...uh, it\\'s important, \\'Becc.I love you, sweetie.\\nCall me back, please.I don\\'t know why that\\'s so hard to figure out.\\n- What makes you think I was ever gonna be...For one thing, I didn\\'t do it.\\nI wasn\\'t there, Mimi.But you should have been,\\nthen everything would have been different.Vince lost his cool, completely.\\nYou wouldn\\'t have, nobody would\\'ve gotten hurt.Somebody didn\\'t get hurt, somebody got killed.\\nA father, a husband, with a family.You think I didn\\'t think about that when\\nso many fathers with families were being killed?And still are!You shouldn\\'t have gone, Mimi.\\nYou should\\'ve said no.We were done.\\n- No. You were done.I never was, but you couldn\\'t accept that.\\n- Mimi...You fooled yourself into thinking\\nI was someone else.And you\\'re still doing it.I am not the one fooling myself, it was over!\\n-  It wasn\\'t... over.It\\'s still not over.Every single thing we said\\nthen, is true today.And every single day, it\\'s getting worse.\\n- That\\'s not the point.Oh, it\\'s exactly the point, Nick!I won\\'t give myself up\\nto a system I despise.I won\\'t give up my freedom and accept\\ntheir version of what life is supposed to be.Mimi, how free are you? Really?\\n- Well, I\\'m not in jail.I don\\'t expect you to understand.\\nThey have you.Oh, like hell.A system that protects the super-rich,\\nand the super, super, super-rich,And fucks over everyone else, and the planet to boot.\\n- Mimi... Mimi, would you just stop?Everyone who\\'s given up and given in,\\nthey\\'re living at the expense of what they once believed.It\\'s so sad!\\nYou understood this,I\\'m sorry you\\'ve forgotten.\\n- I wish I had forgotten!Because my problem is\\nI can\\'t stop remembering.So if you\\'ve built a wall so high, more power\\nto you, you\\'re stronger than I am.I\\'m will turn myself in...the day the politicians and corporations\\nturn themselves in for all they\\'ve done.That\\'s the day I\\'ll hand myself in.\\nScout\\'s fuckin\\' honor.Stop hiding behind your fucking revolutionary rant.\\n- Oh, don\\'t turn it on me.You know what I see?I see the same person.\\nI see it, kid.I see it in your eyes.You can hide from everyone else in the world,\\nand be somebody else, but not with me.What are your memories, Mi?\\nThe ones you can\\'t run away from.Hey!We had a responsibility beyond the cause.We had a baby.We were so consumed by our principles,that we abandoned our most\\nfundamental duty.We were doing our duty, Nick.We made a plan, that if anything ever went wrong,\\n- Never should have carried out that plan.we would know exactly\\nwhat we had to do.We both agreed.\\n- We were wrong.We had no choice.\\n- We should have known that we were wrong.We both accepted it,and we both had to live with it.It wasn\\'t a dream...it was a possibility,\\nwe could have made a reality.We could make them stop.Yeah, we could change things,if we could make a difference.I still believe in that possibility.Is that all you believe?Can you put me through to\\nBen Shepard please?(Aw, shit!)\\nRebecca!What did you say to my dad?\\nHe sounds really upset.What do you mean?\\n- He left me a dozen voice messages last night,he said it had to do with you.What is going on?\\n- You\\'re gonna have to talk to your father.You\\'re up.I remember when these trees were so small,\\nyou could see clear across the water.I saw her.What?I\\'ve went to do Ann Arbor on my way...I didn\\'t want to.\\nI just...couldn\\'t help myself.I sat in my car like\\nsome kind of stalker.Mim.She\\'s really something, Nicky.Truly.We always intended to\\ntell you the truth.You always intended...?At the time we felt...\\n- We hoped that nobody needed to know.I never asked about my birth parents,I really never needed to know.We know. There\\'s no way\\nto make this easier.We redid your identity,\\npapered a legal adoption.None of that matters to me.Did you think I\\ncouldn\\'t handle it?Sweetie, we gotta talk through this.No one\\'s perfect, \\'Becc.I love youI love you too.I can\\'t do what you\\nwant me to do, Nicky.I know.I guess I was hoping you would\\nbecome the person who could.So it goes.Sir, the local K-9 units are on the way.\\n- Roger that.Hello?I\\'m here alone!Hello?You?!You expecting to see somebody else?She here?\\n- Who\\'re we talking about?Who\\'re we talkin\\' about. Mimi Lurie!\\nThat\\'s who you came to see, right?Huh?\\n- Mimi Lurie. That\\'s who you came to see, correct?Why would I do that?\\n- She could testify that you weren\\'t at the bank.Almost sounds like a news story, doesn\\'t it?Unfortunately, I need a source.\\n- Really? Must be a new policy.Is she here, Nick?She never was.You call \\'em?\\n- No.Well you got yourself a story, kid. Congratulations.\\nI hope you\\'re satisfied.I don\\'t wanna see a guy go to jail for the\\nrest of his life for something he didn\\'t do.Is that what passes for idealism these days?\\n- Is Mimi gonna surrender?No.\\n- No. So, where are you going?Well, before she can not surrender,\\nshe has to first not get caught.I don\\'t understand, there\\nwas an easier way.Usually is.You\\'ll learn that lesson.You know, I met your daughter.Your older daughter.Then you really do have yourself a story, don\\'t ya\\'?I\\'m guessing you didn\\'t just stumble into this information...by my count, there are exactlyfour people on the planet that...knew about this...You get let in on something like this, Ben...\\nyou get answers, but not the ones you think.Secrets are a dangerous thing, Ben.We all think we want to know them,\\nbut if you\\'ve kept one to yourself...You come to understand that doing so means that\\nyou may learn something about somebody else,but you also discover something about yourself.I hope you\\'re ready for that.At this point,\\nI have no more secrets.You\\'re a smart guy...Hold on, I\\'m not gonna hurt you.You know exactly what motivates me,\\nand has for the last thirty years.What you\\'re gonna have to\\nfigure out, is what motivates you.I hope you like the answer.\\n- Hold on. Nick. Nick!When the FBI comes, they\\'ll follow me.\\nThey\\'ll never know she was here.There he is.What\\'s that? That\\'s it.\\nCome on! Come on.Alright... we\\'ll take up, you guys flank around from there.There he is!Nicholas Sloan!You\\'re under arrest for the\\nmurder of Hugh Kroessna.Can\\'t say I\\'m happy to see you.Mimi Lurie, last remaining fugitive\\nfrom the 1980 Bank of Michigan robbery,surrendered herself to authorities today\\nnear Drummond Island, Michigan,just across the water from Canada.She confessed to her role in the robbery, which\\nresulted in the death of a guard.Charges have been dropped against Nicholas Sloan,long thought to be a co-conspirator\\nin the robbery.No comment yet from Sloan, who is expected\\nto be released from custody as early as tomorrow.In other news today...I have nothing to say.Subtitles painstakingly transcribedSubtitles painstakingly transcribed\\nby chalket.'"

Boy talk.Yeah.What about the cameras\\nin the lab?And the latch on the container?You\\'re imagining things.That\\'s mine.That\\'s mine too.- Nobody likes a smart guy.\\n- You must be very popular.- You disrespecting me, punk?\\n- I\\'m not looking for any trouble.Found you, anyway.Warning.. Unauthorized physical contact\\nis a violation.Behavior modification\\nwill commence in five seconds.Suspended.You fuckin\\' broke my rib!\\nYou broke my nose!- Are you all right?\\n- I\\'m okay.Let me see.\\nYou may have broken it.Why did you suspend\\nbehavior modification?- Because it amused me.\\n- Violence amuses you?It has its moments.\\nWho\\'s that with Brennick?Rivera, Elena.Convicted of terrorism\\nand sedition...in connection\\nwith the Durango uprisings.Were any of our other guests\\nimplicated in Durango?\"What a tangled web we weave.\"- I\\'m afrraid I do not understand.\\n- I should hope not.Why are you treating me like this?Treating you like what?We\\'re here together...in this horrible place.Can\\'t we at least try to make things\\na little more tolerable for each other?Not this time.You know, you\\'re never\\ngoing to see her again.Yes, I will.Or I\\'ll die trying.What\\'s the status\\nof my favorite fugitives?The latest recovery team\\nwas detained...by local authorities\\nnorth of the border.A further incursion could result\\nin a formal complaint to the embassy.I don\\'t care.She\\'s an escaped convict,\\na multiple breeder.Her illicit offspring is the property\\nof the Men-Tel Corporation.This will not be over\\nuntil they\\'re all here.One big, happy family.I really need to talk to you.I\\'m sorry about last night.Just once I wish someone would\\nfeel about me...the way you feel about your wife,\\nyou know?What are you doing?I\\'m going out in the container.You\\'re nuts.\\nYou\\'ll suffocate in there.I won\\'t be in there\\nlong enough to suffocate.I\\'m gonna hijack the shuttle\\nas soon as it leaves the station.Using what?- Help me grab his weapon.\\n- Load \\'em up.What\\'s wrong with your encoder?\\nThis goddamn thing won\\'t work.- You can\\'t talk to her like that.\\n- All I said was \"damn.\"- You said \"goddamn.\"\\n- Don\\'t let it happen again.- Or we\\'ll report you.\\n- Report me?Are you two sniffing paint up here?\\nYou better sort your shit out fast.Good as new.Like taking candy from a baby.Think. What if you\\'re caught?I don\\'t have any choice here.Teller\\'s after my wife and son...and he\\'s going to get them\\nunless I get to them first.Are you gonna help me or not?Cover me up.- Where\\'s Brennick?\\n- Still packing.- What are you looking at? Help her.\\n- Yes, sir.I got it. Here we go.- Watch it.\\n- Right this way.Let\\'s go.- What was that?\\n- Pull it out.- It\\'s just--\\n- Pull it out!Let\\'s go!Open it.\\nI said open it, goddamn it!Oh. There it is. Sorry.It\\'s just my encoder.Do we have a problem?No, sir. No problem.Miss Combs, doyou have any idea\\nwhat it costs...to keep prisoners\\njust standing round idle?113.5 credits per prisoner.A rhetorical question, ZED.\\nThankyou.You\\'re welcome.Just try to keep things moving.You heard the man.\\nSeal it up, and let\\'s go.Shit.Did you really think\\nit would be that easy?But thank you for pointing out\\nthe defects in our security.You two? Fired. Mr. Gordon.Cut all the prisoner\\'s rations\\nin half...and double their work day.Thank you.What do I do with him?Put him in the hole.Move!You caught Brennick\\ntrying to escape?I suppose you\\'ve called up\\nto congratulate me.Now tell me what happened.What happened is I\\'ve got Brennick\\ncooking in the box...Like a Honey baked ham.I shipped enough reflector plates...to create a downlink\\nthe size of Rhode lsland.I\\'m on target\\nto beat our transmission date.So is it so hard\\nto say \"well done\"?Fine. You did a good job.\\nWhat next?I\\'d quite like to finish\\nthe other generator.Would you get serious?It won\\'t cost you a dime. I have all the\\nlabor and materials I need right here.Al I\\'ll need from you\\nis an electronaccelerator.What for?Well, I\\'ll be able to use it...integrate the two generators.We\\'ll be able to quadruple\\nour power output overnight.You know as well as I do there\\'s\\nno such thing as too much power.I can\\'t disagree with you there.Go ahead.\\nKnock yourself out.Do give my love to Daddy.My man, question.Is it warmer than this\\nup in the hole?Would you like to find out?Asshole.Quit using up all the hot water.- Danny asleep?\\n- Why? Feeling bashful?I won. I beat you, Dad.What are you talking about?\\nYou can\\'t win.They control everything\\nand everyone.I\\'m not leaving without you.Shall I release him from the hole?He\\'s already exceeded normal\\nlife expectancy by seven hours.Show me Brennick.Why, suppose he\\'s about done.All right. Get him out.Keep it moving.I\\'ve got a tug full ofwater\\nwaiting for you jerk-offs to finish.- I thought you might be dead.\\n- No such luck.- Tell me about it.\\n- Mind your own business.First of all,\\nthis is my business.We\\'re working round the clock because\\nJohn got a hankering to see his wife.At least he had\\nthe courage to try.What the hell\\'s\\nthat supposed to mean?It means he cares about someone\\nother than himself...which is more than\\nI can say for you.I ain\\'t see no fan mail\\ncome down here for you, either!Instead of\\narguing with each other...maybe we should be trying to find\\na way out of this place.Yeah. Before things\\nget anyworse around here.There\\'s a contusion\\non the subject\\'s right patella.There\\'s a small abrasion\\non the subject\\'s lefthip.There\\'s still some evidence\\nof dehydration...but the effects of hypothermia\\nhave almost disappeared.There is some\\nresidual skinblemishes...resulting from\\ncosmicradiation burns.There are no other\\napparent malfunctions.Prisoner number 27609...you are authorized\\nto return to the workforce.Have a nice day.Mr. Karensky would like\\na word with you.I\\'m listening.Mr. Karensky feels your escape attempt\\nhas done us all a great disservice.Mr. Karensky believes you are now\\nindebted to him...for the additional hours\\nwe all have had to work.Mr. Karensky believes that the woman\\nwill be fair recompense...for the inconvenience\\nyou have caused.She is not mine to give.Then perhaps...you can take her place.That\\'s flattering,\\nbut I think I\\'ll pass.- What did they want?\\n- Something about relations.International relations.It\\'s no joke.Those Russians will cut your heart out\\njust to see the look on your face.I don\\'t think it\\'s my heart\\nthey\\'re interested in.Jesus! If you don\\'t get the dirty,\\nfilthy thing out of here--I told you keep that sucker\\noutta my food!- I tried. He won\\'t eat it.\\n- He\\'s eating something.- Look at the size ofthat motherfucker.\\n- Knock it off.It\\'sjust a bug.Bug, my ass. Roachzilla, maybe.You notice anything funny\\nabout those security cameras?Yeah.They\\'re not even focusing\\non what we do.Then how do they monitor us?I tell you one thing.\\nYou better figure it out...before we have to learn how to say\\n\"I\\'m your bitch\" in Russian.I\\'m Dr. Preminger.Today\\'s topic..\\nLearning to love your self.I would like each and everyone of you\\nto take a good look at the wonder--Would you please shut up?At least you didn\\'t have to listen\\nto that while you were in the hole.Reach down and grab--- Yo, shut up!\\n- Partner, she can\\'t hear you.Every god damn day.\\nShut up!- Feel better now?\\n- Yeah, it was worth it.- What\\'s that?\\n- A frequency modulator.That\\'s a channel changer to you.Why would they need a channel changer\\nif they\\'ve only got one channel?All right, ladies and gentlemen.\\nStep on out.Let\\'s move it.\\nWe have a lot of work to do.I need you to listen up.Not you.- What\\'s up?\\n- Boss wants him on hard labor.This whole area\\nneeds to be completed.We need the wires repositioned\\nand the wall panels put back up.So listen up.You know the drill.Been waitin\\' a long time for this!You\\'re a dead man.\\nReally. A dead man.Unauthorized physical contact\\nis a violation.Shall I suspend\\nbehavior modification?You\\'re learning.Behavior modification suspended.Hold it!How do you wanna go?Look out!Guess that makes us even.Even, my ass.\\nWhat the hell happened down here?You know what happened.\\nWhere were you?On my break.\\nYou got a problem with that?And where was ZED?My apologies. We\\'ve been experiencing\\nsome technical difficulties.I\\'m sure all these problems\\nwill be eliminated shortly.Hey, Colonel Sanders. I heard\\nyou fried that redneck motherfucker.- Where are the others?\\n- They down at the snack shack.It\\'s all-you-can-eat lobster\\ntonight.What do you want, bozo?Food, not this shit.How bad do you want it?Hey, Kev. Come here\\nand look at this.Bezinsky and Sato.\\nThis ought to be good.- What are you working on?\\n- A remote.- Where did you get it?\\n- The tuner I got from the TV.The keypad and stuff\\nI got from the new work area.Go sit down.If not for this, I\\'d tear off your head\\nand shit down your throat.Would you suspend behavior mode\\non 27321, please?My pleasure, Mr. Sato.Behavior modification for\\nprisoner 27321 has been suspended.Your move, bozo.Let\\'s get outta here.Pass it from the right wing\\nin to the center.- Goal!\\n- There you go.That\\'s what I\\'m talking about.I\\'m good, man.\\nI\\'m good.Is that one of\\nthose independent films?Kiss my ass.We tapped into\\ntheir surveillance system.Are you all right?\\nI heard about what--- How do you do that?\\n- Ask him.- You gotta be kidding me.\\n- Girl, you better recognize my skills.I can build a radio station out of\\na milk carton and two condom wrappers.- What\\'s up with the Russians?\\n- They\\'re not even watching.The fight\\'s a diversion.They\\'re up to something.Damn. It\\'s like they got cameras\\ninside their heads.What are you doing?\\nTurn it back!Yo, that\\'s me.- Kill it.\\n- No doubt.- What\\'s wrong?\\n- The implants they gave us.They tap into the optic nerve.They see what ever we see.That\\'s enough!You ever touch me again,\\nand I\\'ll kill you.- You got it?\\n- Yeah. I understand you completely.Well, that was entertaining.Come on, Newman.\\nGo for a walk.With the right parts, could you stitch\\ntogether some kind of video recorder?With my eyes closed.That would be the way to do it.ZED, what\\'s the prognosis\\non the second generator?There seems to be ananomaly\\nin the acquisition files.- Anomaly?\\n- The output figures...for the new electron accelerator...are well in excess\\nof our power requirements.Planning for the future.I cross-refrerenced the acquisition file\\nwith future projections...and found no relevant data.I haven\\'t had a chance to file\\nall our future plans as yet.It\\'s difficult for me to function\\nat full efficiency...if I don\\'t have access\\ntoall relevant data.Now let\\'s get\\none thing straight here.I decide what\\'s relevant data,\\nnot you.So don\\'t bore me with these\\nanomalies unless I ask you to.Is that clear?That\\'s it, guys.\\nWe\\'re on playback.You guys owe me big time.That scanner chip only has\\nabout four minutes recording time.So everyone listen up.I\\'m sorry, man.Doyou think this uniform\\nmakes me look fat?What we have to do first\\nis find a way around ZED.Forget about ZED. What are we\\ngonna do for transportation?We\\'re going to hijack\\nthe Venture Star.-\\'Cause it worked so well the last time?\\n-There has to be anotherway.Like what?\\n\" Beam me up, Scotty\"?The Russians have a shuttle.Excuse me?What makes you think\\nthey have a shuttle?Because I\\'m a lieutenant...with the Russian\\nFederal Security Service.I have been watching them plot\\nwhile they\\'re playing chess.It\\'s an old gulag trick.Most ofwhat they say is garbage...but when they touch the queen,\\nit\\'s relevant.Pretty hard to crack\\nif you don\\'t know the rules.Then let\\'s talk to them.I gotta stay undercover.If they figure out who I am...they\\'ll kill me.Then I\\'ll do it.Your chess stinks.You have a skill.I might as well just shuttle...my pieces off the board.That\\'s an unusual choice ofwords.A metaphor, perhaps.Words, they seem meaningless.But can we escape...their consequences?That\\'s it.We\\'re on playback.\\nNow we can talk.You were right.\\nTheir shuttle arrives tomorrow.Tomorrow?Man. So what\\'s their plan?If they had a plan,\\nthey wouldn\\'t need us.- So what\\'s our part?\\n- I told them we knew how to bypass ZED.- Did it occur toyou that we don\\'t?\\n- Yes, but we\\'ve got 24 hours.All we need are the codes\\nto Teller\\'s office...and ZED\\'s security casing.Ain\\'t that a bitch? Man, give me back\\nmy rag! What\\'s wrong with you?- Leave him alone, Marcus.\\n- Leave him alone, my ass.He\\'s a damn klepto.\\nLook at this shit!Oh, oh, oh! Fuck!\\nWhat the f--Newman!- Where did you get this?\\n- I found it.- What is it?\\n- An implant. Our ticket home.Pickitup, ooh, oohPickitup, allright\\nParty over hereParty over thereWho\\'s the man\\nwith the mike in his handDon\\'t even think about it.Damn thing would quit movin\\'.- What exactly are we trying to do here?\\n- Don\\'t hurt him!You better get the hell out of my face.\\nI ain\\'t gonna hurt this damn thing.Just trying to tap into\\nhis nervous system here.Why?Who\\'s the only person on this\\nstation that gets edible food?- Teller. So?\\n- The roach must be eating something.- Can\\'t you get a better picture?\\n- \"Can\\'t you get a better picture?\"Can you do it your damn self?Now let\\'s see what\\'s on the menu.Ooh, ooh! Allright! Go!Must be the cold water.I\\'m going to Teller\\'s office.Don\\'t do anything I wouldn\\'t do.Unauthorized access is a violation.Behavior modification\\nwill commence in five seconds.It\\'s just me, ZED.\\nSuspend.Suspended.He\\'s at Teller\\'s door.This is useless.\\nWe can\\'t see a thing.- So?\\n- We\\'re just about ready.We\\'ve linked the two transmitters\\nand calibrated the aiming device.All we need now\\nis the firing pin.So when does\\nthe accelerator arrive?She\\'s sending it up tomorrow\\nwith the next load of prisoners.She has no idea what\\nwe\\'re planning to do withit.Can I help you?I wouldn\\'t mind getting\\na piece of that myself.Well, thank you for\\nsharing that with me, Mr. Sato.You can go now.So hard to get\\ngood help these days.I believe I have already advised you\\nthat the new electron accelerator...considerably exceeds\\nour power requirements.Now she\\'s sulking.\\nZED, lock down.Newman?Newman\\'s dead.It was for a good cause, you know.Good cause, my ass.\\nWe ain\\'t seen shit!If that shuttle arrives\\nand we don\\'t have the codes...the Russians will kill us all.The Russians will be\\nthe least of our problems.What was that, Stan?Buckle my shoe.\\nClose the door.Stan, you\\'re a genius.We didn\\'t have to see the codes.\\nWe heard them.Right this way, ma\\'am.Take me to his office. There\\'s going\\nto be some changes around here.- Susan?\\n- Peter.I\\'ve come up to take over\\nthis operation.You can\\'t.I\\'ve been working on\\nthis project for ten years.My idea to turn the prison\\ninto a power station.My idea to use\\nthe convicts as labor.My idea to tie in\\nthe second generator.You think I\\'m just going to stand by\\nand let you walk awaywith it?Peter, until this moment I didn\\'t\\nthink you actually had any balls.Too bad they\\'re not as big as mine.So sit down,\\nshut up and pay attention.Do you think I wouldn\\'t\\nhave found out...about your black op that\\ncaptured Brennick in Canada?Stalking his wife and son,\\noverriding ZED...executing inmates.If anyone else finds out\\nabout what you\\'ve been doing...you\\'ll be a resident here\\ninstead of the super.- Do you understand me?\\n- Absolutely.Good! Then let\\'s unpack that\\nelectron thing and show me to my room.Do you remember the first code?Two, three, six.\\nPick up sticks.Good. The second.Nine, two, four.\\nOpen the door.He\\'s never going to remember.\\nLet one ofus go.He\\'s the only one who can cross the pain\\nzone without having his brain fried.No brain, no pain.You ready?There you go.Man, this motherfucker\\'s\\ncross-eyed.Gotta be kiddin\\' me.\\nThis shit ain\\'t gonna work.It\\'ll be fine.\\nGo and get \\'em, Stan.Go.- Huh?\\n- Unauthorized access.- Kev, check this out.\\n- Behavior modification...will commence in five seconds.- Four, three, two--\\n- Oh, forget it.- It\\'s just the nitwit.\\n-Suspended.I\\'ve done levels 432, 659 and 224.- Hello.\\n- And I got nothing.- Everything\\'s negative?\\n- Yes.- Why don\\'t you help check it?\\n- Will do.- Nice.\\n- Not now, you dingbat.Pick up sticks.\\nPick up sticks.Six, Two, three, six.Six.Come on, Stanley.\\nCome on.Open the door.\\nOpen the door.Let\\'s go.\\nPaul, get the Russians.Go to heaven.Warning. Warning. Unauthorized entry\\nis a level one violation.Commencing behavior modification.\\nWarning.Warning. Unauthorized entry\\nis a level one violation.- Behavior modification...\\n- Get out of the way!will achieve terminal status\\nin five seconds.- Cut the power!\\n- I\\'m trying!Don\\'t hurt her!\\nShe\\'s nice!One. Administering.Get to the shuttle station now!- Come on, Stanley!\\n- Okay. Okay. Okay.Rivera has that repressive,\\ncompulsive thing.- What?\\n- You know, where you have to...wash your self over and over again.Damn it.Son of a bitch.Okay.Come on!\\nWhere the hell are they?Hey!We\\'re not going without the others.Mr. Karensky regrets that we will be\\nunable to accommodate your friends.But, of course, you understood that.\\nNikolai?Good-bye, pig!I got a feelin\\' that\\'s\\nnot a Russian salute.Nice shot, though I say it myself.Damn! That\\'s the first time\\nI was happy I missed a ride.Don\\'t die on me, Max.My name is Yuri Rienkov.Abandoned by his colleagues\\nand murdered in cold blood.Heartrending.\\nDon\\'t you think so, Mr. Tubman?- You traitorous son of a bitch.\\n- What in the hell is going on here?- Susan!\\n- That weapon was not authorized.It\\'s clever, though, isn\\'t it?A hundred trillion volts\\nof electromagnetic pulse...powered by vast amounts of\\nMen-Tel\\'s cheap electricity.And now you\\'ve brought me\\nthe firing pin.I can burn any target\\nin the Northern Hemisphere.Gentlemen,\\nlet\\'s get this overwith.Let go of me!I didn\\'t mean for it\\nto end this way.You must be very disappointed.Please!- Guess again.\\n- Good-bye,John.- Next.\\n- No!Get her off me!Whoo! That hurt, didn\\'t it?\\nDidn\\'t it?You bitch!Fuck you!Mr. Sato, get ZED\\nto restore surveillance.Mr. Tubman, toss these\\nthree miscreants into the hole.Mr. Gordon, have someone\\nclear this up, will you?So it was a setup\\nfrom the beginning, Nestor.- You used me to find Brennick.\\n- Wasn\\'t me. Told you.You were the closest one\\nto Brennick.If anybody could lead us to him,\\nit was you.Too bad about the wife\\nand kid though.You know what?\\nYou a real humanitarian, bro.Do I look like your brother,\\nconvict?Prisoner number 27609,\\nBrennick, John, W.- File deleted.\\n- Good-bye.Nice and easy now.Look out!It can\\'t be that hard!Sorry.ZED?Systems check.An explosion in airlock 17\\nhas compromised...the structural integrity\\nof that entire sector.Orbital deterioration will become\\ncritical in approximately ten minutes.- What?\\n- An explosion in airlock -I heard you.\\nCan you seal off that sector?The damage to my system precludes me\\nfrom initiating structural repairs.Sealing doors 16 and 18\\nwill have to be closed manually.- What are you doing?\\n- Trying to get out of this place...before it blows up.Relax. The construction\\'s modular.\\nZED can seal up the damaged section.Besides, where areyou\\ngoing to go?Brennick, wait!\\nStay with me.I\\'ll call my office.\\nThey\\'ll send someone to come get us.- And then what?\\n- Then I\\'ll pardon you.You are gonna pardon me?- No, thanks, lady.\\n- Brennick, wait!The station\\'s orbit\\nwill continue to deteriorate...until both sealing doors\\nare secured.- Sir, the prisoners--\\n- Not now.We have a damaged sector\\nin the new wing.- We\\'ll have to seal it off manually.\\n- Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Teller.There\\'s an outgoing\\ntransmission from sector 17.- Outgoing? Retrieve it.\\n- Are you listening to me?Of course, Susan. You want me\\nto send a spaceship up there...because your stepson\\ntried to kill you...but a prisoner named Beswick\\nsaved your life, right?- It\\'s Brennick, you idiot!\\n- Brennick.- I\\'ll have to get back to you on this.\\n- Wait, wait!ZED, behavior modification...highest level.John Brennick.I\\'m sorry, but that file has\\nbeen deleted from the system.By whom?You said delete all casualties.Casualties means dead, you cretin!Yo! Wait up!Come on!Oh, damn!\\nWhat the hell you do that for?- I\\'m sorry! I didn\\'t know it was you!\\n- You\\'re lucky it was your head.Listen. Get everyone to the water tank.\\nWe\\'re going out on the tug.ZED, why didn\\'tyou\\ntell me about this?You instructed me\\nnot to report anomalies...unless specifically requested\\nto do so.Orbital deterioration will become\\ncritical in approximately eight minutes.- What?\\n- Have you developed a hearing defect?Unless you want the station\\nto collapse like an egg carton...you better get up there\\nand seal off the damaged section!Now where you goin\\'?I\\'ve been hiding\\nfrom Men-Tel for 10 years.I\\'m not gonna let my son\\ngrow up that way.Besides, someone has\\nto turn off the lights.You can\\'t use those up here!\\nYou\\'ll pierce the hull!The last thing I\\'m worried about\\nis another prick in the hull.You seal this.\\nI\\'ll start on the other one.Bingo.Look what crawled out\\nof the recycle bin.Don\\'t be stupid.\\nThe whole place is about to go down.Nah.Just you.Lethal dose.Drop your weapon, Sato.I am not going to let you\\nkill another man in cold blood.Didn\\'t I tell you never\\nto touch me again?Everyone! Keep moving!ZED, show me Brennick!Wait a minute. D-2.ZED? Stop them!I\\'m sorry. My system requirements\\nare presently overloaded.Orbital deterioration\\nwill become critical in four minutes.Stanley, come on.I can\\'t-- I-- I can\\'t--Shit! Don\\'t say a word.- Stanley, let\\'s go! Let\\'s go.\\n- Come on!- Go!\\n- Okay.Where\\'s Sato and Gordon?- Sato is missing, and Gordon is dead.\\n- Damn it!You get up there and seal it off.Let\\'s go! Keep movin\\'!- Let\\'s go! Get outta here!\\n- Don\\'t look down!Come on, Stanley!\\nLet\\'s go!He can\\'t just have disappeared.- Perhaps he is at the new transmitter.\\n- Patch me through then.I\\'m afrraid you will\\nhave to do that manually.You denied me access to\\nthe transmitter area six days ago.Because you were reporting everything\\nI did to the Men-Tel Corporation.Reporting is an automatic function.I have no control overit.ZED, you betrayed me.Whoa!You left the water running.Access restored. Find him.I have located John Brennick\\nin the transmitter control room.Not my gun!Orbital deterioration\\nwill become critical in one minute.- Help me!\\n- Not now. Brennick\\'s got the weapon.Forget Brennick!\\nWe gotta seal the door!Teller, think!\\nThe weapon is pointed at Earth!Now what\\'s he gonna do with it?\\nHelp me.Total orbital collapse\\nwill occur in ten seconds.Nine, eight, seven...six, five, four...three, two--The damaged sector\\nhas been secured.Orbital stability\\nis being restored.ZED\\'s coming back on-line.\\nWe\\'ve got to get out of here now.- What about Brennick?\\n- He\\'s dead.I saw it myself.\\nTeller shot him twice.Look, I\\'m the president of Men-Tel!I\\'m ordering you to get off\\nof this space station now--We\\'re not going anywhere,\\nyou bitch.What the hell\\'s he doin\\'?The panels?It\\'s over,John.\\nStep away from the controls.Get over there!Ten years.I feel like I know you...better than anyone\\nI\\'ve known in my whole life.I wouldn\\'t bet on that.A massive power surge has destroyed\\nall of the station\\'s critical functions.All personnel must\\nevacuate immediately.A massive powersurge has destroyed\\nall of the station\\'s critical functions.All personnel must\\nevacuate immediately.Prisoner number 27609,\\nBrennick, John, W.You are charged with sedition,\\nsabotage, escape...with aiding and abetting fugitive\\nidentified as Brennick, Karen.You are also charged with--Teller! It\\'s over!\\nGet up the stairs!You get up there,\\nand you bring him down!Have a nice--Prisoner number 27609--You\\'re out of your fuckin\\' mind!You traitorous piece of shit!- Take my hand!\\n- I\\'m sorry.- Take my hand!\\n- Sabotage, escape--Identified as Brennick--I\\'m losin\\' it!- We\\'ve got him!\\n- Hurry up!Cut it loose!Hold on!- Dial the system!\\n- Everybody, hold on!Mom, look.- It\\'s a shooting star.\\n- Ahh.You can make a wish.I wish--If you tell anyone,\\nyour wish won\\'t come true.I wish my dad would come home.Take us home.- Oh, Danny, Danny, Danny!\\n- Dad!'"
