What\\'s the point?The point is for the kids\\nto enjoy the game without competition.Yeah, but competition is the game.You know, it\\'s like life.Let me ask you something.I mean, how do you even\\nknow who\\'s winning?In this league, we don\\'t keep score.Every game ends in a tie.Oh, no.No agony of defeat?

The shot heard round the world.Let me tell you about it.It\\'s 1951. Long time ago.Brooklyn Dodgers,\\nNew York Giants.And they hated each other.L-Like Luke S-Skywalker and D-Darth Vader.Worse.Well, the baseball season ends\\nand they\\'re tied.Now, this one game would decide...who would go to the World Seriesagainst the great New York Yankees.Biggest game in the history of New York.Bottom of the ninth inning, two outs,the Giants are losing 4 to 2...and a batter\\nnamed Bobby Thomson comes up to bat.<i>Bobby Thomson\\nup there swinging.</i><i>He \\'5 had two out of three,</i><i>a single and a double, and Billy Cox is--</i>Close your eyes. Close your eyes, come on.Close your eyes and you can see it.<i>Bobby hitting at .292.</i><i>Lockman without\\ntoo big of a lead at secondÂ\\x93</i><i>but he \\'ll be running like the wind\\nif Thomson hits one.</i><i>Branca throws.</i><i>There\\'s a long drive!\\nIt\\'s gonna be, I believe--</i><i>The Giants win the pennant!</i><i>The Giants win the pennant!\\nThe Giants win the pennant!</i><i>The Giants win the pennant!</i><i>Bobby Thomson hits\\ninto the lower deck of the left field stands!</i><i>The Giants win the pennant...</i><i>and they\\'re going crazy, they\\'re going crazy!</i><i>And home!</i><i>I don\\'t believe it!</i><i>I do not believe it!</i><i>The Giants won it by a score of 5 to 4...</i><i>and they\\'re picking Bobby Thomson upÂ\\x93</i><i>and carrying him off the field!</i>That\\'s what gave me my dream.Now the big dream,\\nof course, was to announce for the Giants.D-Did you?No. But--.Y-You still might?You never know.C-C-Can I h-hear it again?Sure.<i>Bobby Thomson\\nup there swinging.</i><i>He \\'5 had two out of three,</i><i>a single and a double,\\nand Billy Cox is playing--</i>Honey, we\\'re going to play a\\ngame.

Harper!\\nI cannot allow you to take a talent...a gift to which you have\\ndedicated so much time and effort...and throw it away on a whim.I hate you and I wish\\nanyone else was my mother!Maybe not those words.Thanks, Mom and Dad.I couldn\\'t have\\ngotten through the week without you.I say we head for the airport right now.Don\\'t even take our clothes\\nwe just skedaddle.I followed you for 35 years, Artie.Wherever you needed to be,\\nthat\\'s where I was.No complaints.Well, some.But this week...This week was supposed to be about\\nus and our grandchildren.Not you.Not you.Did you have to go to that audition?It\\'s not one of my better moments.For one wonderful hour...we weren\\'t the \"other\" grandparents.Oh.There you are.You okay?I\\'ve had better Mommy days.You know, it may not have been\\nhorrible to let her go to that party.I know.I just walked into that scene and I freaked.I can\\'t believe my parents killed Carl.Well, I was thinking about that.You know, they didn\\'t kill\\nCarl, only Barker could do that.And it somehow took us\\nnot being here for him to do it.So, what\\'s your point?Maybe we coddle him too much.Maybe he needed a little tough love...to let go of his imaginary friend.But, Phil, that would make my father right.Yeah. We can\\'t have any of that.Harper?I could come back.No, no, no, it\\'s okay.I\\'m going to check on Barker.Thanks, Phil.I\\'m sorry.For what?Narrow it down for me, Dad.For this week.For almost getting Barker hurt today.I just feel terrible about that.What were you even doing there?I was on an audition.Because the Grizzlies fired me.What?Why didn\\'t you tell us?Because it\\'s humiliating.Why would they do that?You\\'re so good at that job.Maybe not good enough.Alice...your mom was really hoping...that this trip would help bring\\nher closer to her grandchildren.And she and Harper have developeda relationship that\\'s kind of great...and I don\\'t want\\nto see that end just because I screwed up.- What about you?\\n- Hmm?Don\\'t you want a relationship\\nwith your grandchildren?Of course I do.I mean...like an hour\\nbefore you came home, it was really good.It\\'s just that sometimes...I don\\'t feel...What?...welcome, here.What happened to us, Dad?How old were you when Harper was born?- Twenty-six.\\n- Mmm-hmm.Did you know what you were doing?No.I was 23 when you came along.And I was terrified, because you didn\\'t\\ncome with any instructions.And I thought I was doing okay.Because unlike my father,\\nI wasn\\'t constantly telling you...what an annoying little waste\\nof time you were...and believe me, I\\'m cleaning that up.And I thought that we were\\nactually having fun.Me and the weather girl...and the cutest little girl you ever saw,\\ntraveling around the country.But then years go by,\\nand your daughter goes off to college...and she doesn\\'t come home\\nfor Thanksgiving or Christmas.Or summers.Or ever.And you get these clues, this inkling...that perhaps all those years\\nshe wasn\\'t having such a good time...and that maybe she thought\\nyou didn\\'t do such a good job.And that really hurts. Doesn\\'t it?Yes.So, little girl,\\nI have to give you three put-ups.- No, Dad.\\n- Please.It\\'s okay.Harper, Turner, Barker.They\\'re great kids\\nand you\\'re a really good mother.Yeah.I\\'m basking in the glow\\nof my children\\'s affection.Harper? She didn\\'t mean anything.I mean, she\\'s 12.Get ready, it\\'s going to get a lot worse.Only, don\\'t let her turn her back on you.Because that will break your heart.Harper?No. Um...Barker has a special request\\nfor tomorrow, before the audition.And it involves all of us.Carl, your two favorite things were milk\\nand tofu dogs.Now, you can have both forever.Grandma, thanks for decorating the box.Oh, honey, it was my pleasure.Um,Carl...Can Artie say something nice for Carl?Me?How do you--.I\\'m sorry, Carl.He died so young.Mmm.How do you say goodbye\\nto somebody you could never say hello to?It\\'s hard.I didn\\'t get to see Carl very often,but then again, nobody else did.Except for Barker...which is what made him so special.Carl wasn\\'t just Barker\\'s friend,\\nhe was a part of him.And that made him a part of all of us.Carl, you will forever be in our hearts.Keep on hopping, buddy.Okay.Alice, you take Harper backstage.\\nWe\\'ll grab some seats.Barker, Turner, you\\'re with us.- Good luck.\\n- Knock them dead.Thanks.Break a leg.Bye, Dad.Don\\'t applaud. That\\'s that woman!<i>Good evening.</i><i>Welcome family, friends\\nand distinguished judges...</i><i>to the Atlanta Performing Arts Center.</i><i>I am Doctor Sch veer.</i><i>We have 74 amazingly talented musicians...</i><i>all vying for one position\\nat this prestigious conservatory.</i><i>So, without further ado I give you</i><i>Chet Halloran on the saxophone</i>Yeah! Go Chet!Hang on a second, honey.You know,\\nwhen you were just five years old...we took you to that\\nlittle music school for the first time.And all the other kids\\nthey were just banging on things.One kid tried to play another kid.But from that very first day, you played.And not just played...you had this look\\nof such fulfillment on your face.And I said to your dad, \"Whatever it takes...\"whatever we have to do, I always\"want to see that look on her face.\"Lately, I\\'m not seeing it.So, honey, do you\\nreally not want to switch schools again?Okay.What do you say we ditch this audition?Really?Yeah. It\\'s okay.Mommy, I didn\\'t mean what I said.Oh, baby.I wouldn\\'t want anyone else to be my mom.And I love you.That\\'s good\\nbecause you\\'re my only daughter.And you know,\\nI don\\'t really understand the boys.I know. How weird are they?Yeah, yeah!Hi, baby.We regret to inform you\\nof a slight change in our program.Harper Simmons has forfeited her slot...and her future.Since the next performer is warming up...we\\'re going to have to take\\na 10 minute break.Hey. what\\'s going on?She\\'s not going to audition.You\\'re not disappointed in me, are you?Oh, no, no, no. That\\'s not even a possibility.Is this is all my fault? It is, isn\\'t it?I came 3,000 miles\\nto ruin my granddaughter\\'s life.It\\'s not your fault.- Really?\\n- It was our choice.I love you.Here, take my picture, Phil.- Get in there.Uh, where\\'s Turner?You! Kid!Turner!<i>Bobby Thomson, up there swinging.</i><i>He\\'s had two out of three,\\na single and a double...</i><i>and Billy Cox is playing him\\nright an the third base line.</i><i>One out, last of the ninth.

I went online looking for\\nan explanation about...Wendy, just... just listen\\nto me, all right?All right, look, I went online\\nlooking for an explanation...about what happened,\\nand I found out...about this high school\\nFrench class from New York.Six years ago\\nthey went on a trip to Paris.When they were boarding...a kid had a vision that\\nthe plane was gonna explode.Just like you did.He freaked out...and seven people\\ngot off the plane.Just like us.And on takeoff,\\nFlight 180 blew up.And over the next several months...everyone who got off that plane\\nstarted dying in weird accidents.They died in the order they would\\'ve\\nif they had stayed on the plane.Unless someone intervened,\\nthen it skipped them.Fuck you, Kevin.W-Wendy! Wendy! Hey!Ohh, every time we come here.I was thinking of going\\nfor 20 minutes in the Muller.We did that for all the funerals\\nand it turned out amazing.Yeah, but that was just\\na couple of weeks ago, though.I mean, we\\'re still pretty bronzed.I was just thinking\\nwe could go for, like, a tune-up.I just wanna make sure\\nthat we look our best.Yeah.You know, for all those kids\\nthat died that night...who will never get a graduation.You know what?\\nYou\\'re totally right.- I\\'m sorry.\\n- Mmm.This is my... my good guy\\nluck bracelet...that Grandma left me in her will.Ohh!Julie?I need...I could use some help.I have such...\\nsuch guilt over Jason.I should never have let\\nthat ride go.God.

Heh.I thought maybe\\nhe\\'s been with me since...that night...\\nbefore I got on the ride...Jason said...God, and it was just\\nto get me on the ride...he said...\"Your fear is from a sense\\nof having no control.\"And I\\'ve felt that fear\\nsince the moment he said it.Even thought it maybe somehow\\ncaused the hallucination...but this fear is more\\nthan just being scared.It\\'s like a presence.Like a living thing\\nalways with me.You think it\\'s J?No, I know it\\'s not.This presence is the opposite\\nof how J made me feel.It\\'s cold and terrifying.That\\'s the last photograph\\nLincoln posed for.The photographic plate\\nwas broken...causing a line\\nthat can\\'t be removed.Exactly where he was shot.Look.

Easy.Let\\'s just...let\\'s just take a step back.All right? He was behind\\nAshley and Ashlyn on the ride...but there was no ladder here.\\nYou know, there was no rope.Nothing in that picture pointed to this.We were wrong about the photos.I should\\'ve left town.\\nIt\\'s better not knowing.No, it\\'s never better\\nstaying ignorant.Willful ignorance\\nis surrendering control.What, did you read that somewhere\\nin Mrs. Brooks\\' English class?No. l... you know, I\\'m not...I\\'m not the total idiot\\nyou think I am.OK, that\\'s Lewis after Frank...then lan and Erin.There\\'s a couple of kids behind them,\\nbut I can\\'t make them out...because this guy\\'s arm\\'s\\nin the way. Can you?No.All right, you know what?We\\'ll ask Lewis, lan, and Erin\\nif they remember.OK?Are there any more pictures\\nfrom the roller coaster?I guess...that kind of thing\\nis gonna happen to usfor the rest of our lives.Yeah.You know, I was gonna...I was gonna ask her to marry me.Right after graduation.Heh.Oh.No, wait.Look, behind Stacy.That\\'s Frank.This picture shows how he died.All right, go back to Lewis.All right, go back to Lewis.OK, he\\'s got that hammer.And the weight looks like\\nit\\'s coming down...on his head.No, no, no, check this out.Right now Lewis is down at State\\nfor football training camp.State\\'s team is called the Sultans.That\\'s it. That\\'s the clue.We have to tell him.\\nShow him these pictures.Wouldn\\'t you want to know?Wait, there\\'s pictures of us in there?Yeah.Yeah, of course.Huh. No.No. I don\\'t want to see mine.\\nNo. Huh.What about willful ignorance?Well, I\\'m full of shit, all right?!I mean, I never thought\\nI could see my own death...before it happened, Wendy.No, you know what?\\nWe can tell Lewis, but...Seriously, if there\\'s any way\\nto beat this thing...I gotta stay focused...and if I look at that picture,\\nall I\\'m gonna do is obsess.So, you know what?\\nNo, I don\\'t want to see it.I mean, unless we have to.You mean until we have to.One more thing.Is it bad?I mean, is it, like,\\npainful or embarrassing?I mean, there\\'s nothing, like,\\nup my ass or anything, right?I\\'ll see you tomorrow.You on crack. Both of you.Just listen, OK?\\nAshley and Ashlyn were first.Then Frankie Cheeks\\nand then you. This is the...- Aw, come on, Kevin.\\n- Listen.McKinley and Erin\\nwere next, all right?And there were two people in front of us.\\nDo you remember who they were?Fuck no, and I don\\'t care.\\nAnd you shouldn\\'t care either, man...\\'cause what you\\'re tellin\\' me\\nright now is straight bullshit.Just listen, Lewis.Kevin, it\\'s like those stories.Like this guy was killed\\nby a car he sold 10 years ago.Two sisters, right, were killed when\\nthey were driving to visit each other.You know, shit like that, man.Fuck the Bruins!Oh, yeah! Fuck the Bruins!Bruin faggots!Yeah! Fuck the Bruins!Man, you\\'re reading into this shit\\nlike them damn urban legends.Three people have died, Lewis.I mean, if you think\\nthis can be written off...as a simple coincidence\\nand it ends there...you\\'re in serious denial.Unh! What about you two, huh?What?You both lost people real close\\nto you in a fucked-up way.And in order to feel\\nless guilty or whatever...seeing signs and patterns, man.I don\\'t blame you.\\nBut it\\'s wrong, dawg.Unh! It\\'s wrong.That\\'s denial.Unh!- Unh!\\n- You got it!OK, what about what happened\\nat the roller coaster? Huh?Wendy saw it.Man, she got a hunch.\\nFuckin\\' intense, but she got a hunch.Man, I\\'m here because I get\\ngood hunches before every down.No, you know\\nthey\\'re either gonna run or pass.Hers came to her from nowhere.You\\'re here and alive because of her.No, I\\'m alive because of me.No, listen.\\nYou don\\'t get it, man.Does that make sense to you?There\\'s nothing to get, Kevin!\\nIt\\'s bullshit.No, just hear me out, all right?Unh.# Yeah #Talk about a vision.\\nMan, I seen my whole life played out...and it sure as hell\\nain\\'t gonna end now.

This is just...I don\\'t know. I mean,\\nI wish I knew why, you know?I wish I could... I could\\ncome up with a guess even...to make you feel OK, but...You know, I can\\'t.Yeah.There\\'s nothing I can do.Can you drive?Heh.Yeah.You know, by the way,\\nthat... that picture of me.My, uh, my head\\'s not, like,\\nthrough the windshield or anything?You know,\\ncrushed by a steering wheel?lmpaled by a gear shift?Right?Zip, it\\'s Pip.Have you cut\\nthose plywood orders yet?Uh, that\\'s a big no, Pip.Osama bin Supervisor wants me\\nto get rid of these pigeons first.They keep settin\\' off the alarms.Hello, babies.Ha ha ha!Oh, ha ha ha! Heh.Hey. After I, uh, restock\\nthis stuff...that these pinhead customers\\ncan\\'t manage...to return to the shelves\\nthemselves...we can blow out of here, OK?Righty-o, babe.Aah!Erin, it\\'s Wendy and Kevin.Shit!You scared the shit out of me!Yeah, wait till you hear\\nwhat we have to tell you.Zip, it\\'s Pip. Come over here.You are gonna trip\\nwhen you hear this.Well, paint me intrigued, Pip.\\nI\\'m on my way.So let me get this straight.\\nI\\'m gonna O.D. on nail polish...and lan is gonna be\\nembarrassed to death?You saw what happened\\nto Wendy, right?What\\'s happened to the others?\\nI mean, you just saw their pictures.Oh, my God, guys,\\nwhat\\'s going on?What\\'s going on?\\nThat\\'s crazy! That\\'s crazy!Ha ha!We need to know who was sitting\\nbehind you on the roller coaster.OK, who was sitting behind us\\non the roller coaster?Oh! Oh, wait! Wasn\\'t it\\nthat one guy who got voted...most likely to become\\nmanager at Red Lobster?Oh, no. You know what?\\nGod, I remember.There was this guy,\\nuh, black cloak...I didn\\'t see his face, but, um...the ride attendant\\ndid take his sickle...before the ride started\\nif that\\'s helpful in any way.Do you think we care\\nif you laugh at us?This is our lives, OK?What choice do we have?\\nJust give into it?Oh, God. You know what?\\nThere is no \"it.\"OK, wait, are you guys saying\\nthat Death is, like, a person?No. It\\'s like... like a force.Yeah. Well, you know what?\\nA force is just a force.It\\'s nothing else.\\nJust transferred energy.I mean, it has no goals,\\nno awareness that is a force.But there is awareness, McKinley.In fact, in past cases,\\nif the next in line is saved...it\\'d skip that person.\\nThat\\'s why we\\'re here.Oh, man,\\nwhat have you been smoking?Ha ha!- Top shelf.\\n- OK.Kevin! Those banners.\\nThey\\'re in the picture.lan, watch those boxes!What the fuck, man?\\nYou said those boxes were falling!No, I said watch the boxes.Really? What for?\\nThey\\'re not doing anything.We\\'re not gonna apologize\\nfor trying to save you.You haven\\'t seen or been through\\nwhat we have... yet.Oh. Yet.OK, so who\\'s next in this theory\\nyou have, me or lan?Well, we know the order of how\\nwe were sitting on the roller coaster...but not how it works\\nwith people who sat together.OK, we don\\'t know\\nif Ashley or Ashlyn died first.Hmm. God, Death is\\nfucking complicated.Ha ha!No, you know what?\\nIt\\'s not complicated.It\\'s simple. People die.That\\'s just part of life.150,000 people a day, actually.You know? I mean...we\\'re biological entities,\\nand death is just...- Top shelf.\\n- the end of biological function.It\\'s as simple as that.How can you explain\\nwhat happened to us as simple?I mean, if Wendy never had\\nthat premonition...and none of us had gotten off that ride,\\nwe\\'d all be dead right now.- Does that not make sense to you?\\n- Oh, yeah.Kevin, how come when a guy dies\\nof a plain heart attack...no one goes, like...\"Oh, wow, he was\\neating French toast...\"when Princess Diana\\ndied in Paris...\"and then he saw her funeral on TV,\\nand now he\\'s dead\"?You know why?\\nBecause they\\'d sound crazy...so guess how you two\\nsound right now? Crazy.Zip, I\\'m done.\\nSo finish cutting those orders...- so we can get out of here.\\n- OK!Unh!Heh heh!Ugh!Sick.OK.Let\\'s go with\\nwhat you guys are saying.Let\\'s just say, you know...that Death does have\\na conscious plan...and that it\\'s been\\nset into motion. Great.So, Newton\\'s third law of motion,\\nand, well, look...I\\'m just guessing\\nthat it goes for Death, too...when he\\'s working in our world.Newton says that every action\\nhas an equal and opposite reaction.So, that means that...if Death has taken action,\\nso can we.And that that action\\nwe take might have...an opposite reaction\\nthat thwarts Death\\'s intent.You\\'re being a fucker, but go on.OK. OK.What if, for example...the last in line were to make\\nthe utilitarian choice...Kill themselves.Wow! Wow! That\\'s pretty much\\ngonna ruin any plan...that Death\\'s put in motion.\\nAnd even better...hey, it\\'s gonna save\\nfive skipped lives.Any takers?Nah, I didn\\'t think so.There! Those!Ugh!Aah!Ooh!Aah!Unh! Unh!Unh!Aah!I didn\\'t say anything.\\nI mean, I think...they were trying to scare us\\ninto saying something...but they had nothing\\nto keep me there.What\\'d you tell \\'em?Everything.\\nI didn\\'t do anything.I told them about\\nthe pictures in the camera...and Flight 180\\nand Frankie and Lewis...and why we went to see\\nlan and Erin and...Did they believe you?Yeah, right.\\nWould you believe me?No, they looked at me\\nlike I was crazy.10 hours they had us in there.For all we know...whoever was sitting\\nbehind Erin is already dead.And we\\'re next.Now.lan almost died first,\\nbut we intervened.So it skipped lan.\\nThat\\'s... that\\'s how we regain control.If someone intercedes...the life that was supposed\\nto be next is skipped.All right, wait, wait, wait.So, going by the way we sat\\non the roller coaster...Well, I\\'m next... and then you.We can beat this.We\\'re so close.\\nWe can\\'t give up.All right, my dad\\'s here.\\nHe\\'s gonna give me a ride back.But are you sure\\nwe shouldn\\'t stick together?It\\'s just for a couple of hours.All right? A couple of hours.Go back, look at the pictures,\\nsee if you can find any more clues...and I\\'ll ask everybody I see if they know\\nif anyone else got off the ride.OK?Was there something\\nI should know about going?No, it\\'s just...I\\'ll just be freaking out\\nevery second...hoping you\\'re OK.Why?I mean,\\nwe don\\'t even like each other.Heh.Come here.OK?All right, I got my cell.OK.Hey, Wen?So we\\'re meeting some guys\\nat that centennial thing...and I could really use\\nmy good-luck... bracelet.Mmm.Huh.Hey, this is Julie.\\nLeave a message.Call me on my cell right away.Hello?Do you remember Julie\\nbeing on the roller coaster?What, your sister? No.No, she would\\'ve said\\nsomething by now.The person sitting\\nbehind lan and Erin...was wearing the exact same\\ncharm bracelet...our grandmother gave her.Amber or Perry\\nwere probably with her...so they\\'re next.I gotta find Julie.She went to\\nthe tricentennial thing.Well, l... I\\'m here now,\\nworking security.I\\'ll start looking for her.- I\\'m on my way.\\n- Wen, wait.Look, after them, we\\'re next.So in case somethin\\'\\nhappens to \\'em...before we meet up...remember that time\\nwe talked about?When to look at our pictures?It\\'s now.Great. Mine has no clue.It\\'s just me standing in front of\\na blank background...with Jason at\\nthe amusement park.Wait. McKinley.lan? Is he in the picture?No, but it... it feels like a clue.And yours is the picture\\nthat I took...when I flashed the camera\\nin your face.It\\'s all out of focus\\nand overexposed, like...Like a firework\\nwent off in my face?# There is someone ## Walking behind you ## Look at me ## There is someone ## Watching your footsteps ## Look at me ## There is someone ## Who really loves you #The British are coming!\\nThe British are coming!- Whoo!\\n- Yay!Get \\'em while they\\'re hot!Take it to those Redcoats!Column, advance!The kite is aloft.Now, let us hope\\nfor some lightning.Fuck you, Ben Franklin.But he kept insisting.\\n\"Get over here,\" right?This is awesome, dude!Heh heh.Whoa. Hey!Ha ha! Come on!Hey, get out of here with those, man!\\nYou\\'re gonna set these off!Hurry, dude.Come on, man, let\\'s go!\\nHurry up!Ladies and gentlemen,\\nto celebrate McKinley\\'s tricentennial...the fireworks extravaganza\\nwill begin shortly.Oh, my God.

He has scored!Brad, that is what\\nyou young people would call a \"hottie.\"He\\'s got Britney Spears\\nand he\\'s about to give her the ring...and he goes the other way!I can\\'t believe what I am seeing...and I\\'m sure she\\'s\\ngot a great \"personality,\" but, oh my.I thought Jerry Garcia was dead.What\\'s he doing\\nin the stands marrying him?Here at Chukchansi Park,\\nlove is blind, and apparently so is Nate.All right, let\\'s get back to the actionas the meeting breaks up on the mound.Here\\'s the situation.\\nFirst and third, two outs.<i>And here \\'5 the pitch</i><i>Swing and a miss. Diaz fires down to third.</i><i>They\\'ve picked him off third!</i><i>- You\\'re out!\\n- Ballgame aver!</i>I\\'ll tell you, Myers is getting an earful...and as my mom used to say,\\n\"There\\'s no cure for dumb.\"Gwen!

I\\'ll break his freaking arm.That\\'s great, but that\\'s not what I meant.You see, there\\'s a way\\nthat we talk to our kids.For instance, where you would say \"No\"...we would say,\\n\"Consider the consequences.\"Or where you would say, \"Don\\'t\"...we would say, \"Maybe you should try this.\"Or where you would say...\"Quit your whining,\\nyou\\'re giving me a headache\"...we would say, \"Use your words.\"You see, that way, the child feelsthat he has value, he has worth.He is heard.It\\'s a way.Let\\'s order.Great.That\\'s very good, but if you stayinside the lines, it looks better.Here, look at mine, see?Dad, we don\\'t really worry about lines.Honey, draw whatever\\nyour imagination tells you.But what\\'s the point\\nof having lines if you\\'re just going to...?Artie.That\\'s beautiful.\\nThat\\'s absolutely beautiful.It\\'s very avant-garde.- Picasso.\\n- Exactly.You didn\\'t finish your dinner.\\nYou know the great thing about Chinese...I mean, Pan Asian food,\\nis that if you mush it all up it\\'s...- What happened?- What did you do?\\n- I don\\'t know.He doesn\\'t like his food to touch.I didn\\'t know!

It g-gets too wet.- Is this the right amount?\\n- Uh-uh.Well, eat fast.Okay. Here you go.You have to cut up the berries...and put one piece in each hole\\nin the multigrain waffle.This food can touch?Eggless egg salad coming up.Okay, put the lettuce, hit it with the lettuce.It\\'s fine, they will never know.No crust, no crust.Now there\\'s no sandwich.\\nLook what you made.I like them, Carl likes them. Right, Carl?And your opinion has value.\\nAnd, what\\'s the other one?Worth.But I know from experience\\nthat wearing heels can be tricky.Especially during recess.Wouldn\\'t you and Carl\\nboth be more comfortable in sneakers?No.Hey, what\\'s going on?\\nWe are going to be late.<i>It\\'s Project Hun way.</i>l tried handling\\nit like Alice said, but it\\'s not working.All right,\\nget the other two in the car, I\\'ll handle this.Artie.It\\'s okay. Let me try.Take off those shoes\\nand I\\'ll give you a dollar.- Five.\\n- Two-fifty.Deal.Just punch in \"go to school.\"Why is this easier than\\nyou just telling me how to get there?- l heard <i>that.</i>\\n- Whoa!

Okay.Now, the first time I heard this...I knew right away that I had found my voice.I knew that I had to become\\na baseball announcer.And once I knew that...it didn\\'t matter what anybody\\nelse thought or said about me.Sh-sh-shot heard round the w-world?Right. The shot heard round the world.Let me tell you about it.It\\'s 1951. Long time ago.Brooklyn Dodgers,\\nNew York Giants.And they hated each other.L-Like Luke S-Skywalker and D-Darth Vader.Worse.Well, the baseball season ends\\nand they\\'re tied.Now, this one game would decide...who would go to the World Seriesagainst the great New York Yankees.Biggest game in the history of New York.Bottom of the ninth inning, two outs,the Giants are losing 4 to 2...and a batter\\nnamed Bobby Thomson comes up to bat.<i>Bobby Thomson\\nup there swinging.</i><i>He \\'5 had two out of three,</i><i>a single and a double, and Billy Cox is--</i>Close your eyes. Close your eyes, come on.Close your eyes and you can see it.<i>Bobby hitting at .292.</i><i>Lockman without\\ntoo big of a lead at secondÂ\\x93</i><i>but he \\'ll be running like the wind\\nif Thomson hits one.</i><i>Branca throws.</i><i>There\\'s a long drive!\\nIt\\'s gonna be, I believe--</i><i>The Giants win the pennant!</i><i>The Giants win the pennant!\\nThe Giants win the pennant!</i><i>The Giants win the pennant!</i><i>Bobby Thomson hits\\ninto the lower deck of the left field stands!</i><i>The Giants win the pennant...</i><i>and they\\'re going crazy, they\\'re going crazy!</i><i>And home!</i><i>I don\\'t believe it!</i><i>I do not believe it!</i><i>The Giants won it by a score of 5 to 4...</i><i>and they\\'re picking Bobby Thomson upÂ\\x93</i><i>and carrying him off the field!</i>That\\'s what gave me my dream.Now the big dream,\\nof course, was to announce for the Giants.D-Did you?No. But--.Y-You still might?You never know.C-C-Can I h-hear it again?Sure.<i>Bobby Thomson\\nup there swinging.</i><i>He \\'5 had two out of three,</i><i>a single and a double,\\nand Billy Cox is playing--</i>Honey, we\\'re going to play a\\ngame.

The car killed him!He came out of nowhere!Officer, you\\'re wasting your time.What happened? Why are the police here?Why is the alarm on?- Oh, hi!\\n- Mommy!- Was there a break-in?\\n- It\\'s nothing.It\\'s absolutely nothing.\\nWhat are you doing home?I killed Carl!- What?\\n- You killed Carl?

Get your taser ready.That\\'s not right.Barker was at a play date\\nthis morning with Artie.Oh. yeah?I was in a little bind...and I had to take him\\nwith me on some business.What business did you have\\nat the X Games?Yeah, Artie, what business?Um...Aren\\'t we forgetting\\nthe most serious issue here?What issue?The death of an imaginary kangaroo.He\\'s imaginary?Yes!You can go.Would someone please explain\\nwhat happened to Carl?We were playing Kick the Can...and it started to rain,\\nso we all came indoors...and I was helping\\nHarper get dressed for her party.A party? You\\'re throwing a party?No, Dad, I\\'m going to a party.No, Dad, I\\'m going to a party.For a boy who likes her.A boy? What boy?The night before your audition?\\nAre you kidding?I told her she could go.It\\'s ridiculous. It is out of the question.Maybe it\\'s ridiculous for me to spendall my time practicing the violin...never doing anything else\\nand auditioning for a school tomorrow...where I\\'m never going to do anything elsethe whole rest of my life.Huh?Well, she\\'s using her words.Harper. Harper!\\nI cannot allow you to take a talent...a gift to which you have\\ndedicated so much time and effort...and throw it away on a whim.I hate you and I wish\\nanyone else was my mother!Maybe not those words.Thanks, Mom and Dad.I couldn\\'t have\\ngotten through the week without you.I say we head for the airport right now.Don\\'t even take our clothes\\nwe just skedaddle.I followed you for 35 years, Artie.Wherever you needed to be,\\nthat\\'s where I was.No complaints.Well, some.But this week...This week was supposed to be about\\nus and our grandchildren.Not you.Not you.Did you have to go to that audition?It\\'s not one of my better moments.For one wonderful hour...we weren\\'t the \"other\" grandparents.Oh.There you are.You okay?I\\'ve had better Mommy days.You know, it may not have been\\nhorrible to let her go to that party.I know.I just walked into that scene and I freaked.I can\\'t believe my parents killed Carl.Well, I was thinking about that.You know, they didn\\'t kill\\nCarl, only Barker could do that.And it somehow took us\\nnot being here for him to do it.So, what\\'s your point?Maybe we coddle him too much.Maybe he needed a little tough love...to let go of his imaginary friend.But, Phil, that would make my father right.Yeah. We can\\'t have any of that.Harper?I could come back.No, no, no, it\\'s okay.I\\'m going to check on Barker.Thanks, Phil.I\\'m sorry.For what?Narrow it down for me, Dad.For this week.For almost getting Barker hurt today.I just feel terrible about that.What were you even doing there?I was on an audition.Because the Grizzlies fired me.What?Why didn\\'t you tell us?Because it\\'s humiliating.Why would they do that?You\\'re so good at that job.Maybe not good enough.Alice...your mom was really hoping...that this trip would help bring\\nher closer to her grandchildren.And she and Harper have developeda relationship that\\'s kind of great...and I don\\'t want\\nto see that end just because I screwed up.- What about you?\\n- Hmm?Don\\'t you want a relationship\\nwith your grandchildren?Of course I do.I mean...like an hour\\nbefore you came home, it was really good.It\\'s just that sometimes...I don\\'t feel...What?...welcome, here.What happened to us, Dad?How old were you when Harper was born?- Twenty-six.\\n- Mmm-hmm.Did you know what you were doing?No.I was 23 when you came along.And I was terrified, because you didn\\'t\\ncome with any instructions.And I thought I was doing okay.Because unlike my father,\\nI wasn\\'t constantly telling you...what an annoying little waste\\nof time you were...and believe me, I\\'m cleaning that up.And I thought that we were\\nactually having fun.Me and the weather girl...and the cutest little girl you ever saw,\\ntraveling around the country.But then years go by,\\nand your daughter goes off to college...and she doesn\\'t come home\\nfor Thanksgiving or Christmas.Or summers.Or ever.And you get these clues, this inkling...that perhaps all those years\\nshe wasn\\'t having such a good time...and that maybe she thought\\nyou didn\\'t do such a good job.And that really hurts. Doesn\\'t it?Yes.So, little girl,\\nI have to give you three put-ups.- No, Dad.\\n- Please.It\\'s okay.Harper, Turner, Barker.They\\'re great kids\\nand you\\'re a really good mother.Yeah.I\\'m basking in the glow\\nof my children\\'s affection.Harper? She didn\\'t mean anything.I mean, she\\'s 12.Get ready, it\\'s going to get a lot worse.Only, don\\'t let her turn her back on you.Because that will break your heart.Harper?No. Um...Barker has a special request\\nfor tomorrow, before the audition.And it involves all of us.Carl, your two favorite things were milk\\nand tofu dogs.Now, you can have both forever.Grandma, thanks for decorating the box.Oh, honey, it was my pleasure.Um,Carl...Can Artie say something nice for Carl?Me?How do you--.I\\'m sorry, Carl.He died so young.Mmm.How do you say goodbye\\nto somebody you could never say hello to?It\\'s hard.I didn\\'t get to see Carl very often,but then again, nobody else did.Except for Barker...which is what made him so special.Carl wasn\\'t just Barker\\'s friend,\\nhe was a part of him.And that made him a part of all of us.Carl, you will forever be in our hearts.Keep on hopping, buddy.Okay.Alice, you take Harper backstage.\\nWe\\'ll grab some seats.Barker, Turner, you\\'re with us.- Good luck.\\n- Knock them dead.Thanks.Break a leg.Bye, Dad.Don\\'t applaud. That\\'s that woman!<i>Good evening.</i><i>Welcome family, friends\\nand distinguished judges...</i><i>to the Atlanta Performing Arts Center.</i><i>I am Doctor Sch veer.</i><i>We have 74 amazingly talented musicians...</i><i>all vying for one position\\nat this prestigious conservatory.</i><i>So, without further ado I give you</i><i>Chet Halloran on the saxophone</i>Yeah! Go Chet!Hang on a second, honey.You know,\\nwhen you were just five years old...we took you to that\\nlittle music school for the first time.And all the other kids\\nthey were just banging on things.One kid tried to play another kid.But from that very first day, you played.And not just played...you had this look\\nof such fulfillment on your face.And I said to your dad, \"Whatever it takes...\"whatever we have to do, I always\"want to see that look on her face.\"Lately, I\\'m not seeing it.So, honey, do you\\nreally not want to switch schools again?Okay.What do you say we ditch this audition?Really?Yeah. It\\'s okay.Mommy, I didn\\'t mean what I said.Oh, baby.I wouldn\\'t want anyone else to be my mom.And I love you.That\\'s good\\nbecause you\\'re my only daughter.And you know,\\nI don\\'t really understand the boys.I know. How weird are they?Yeah, yeah!Hi, baby.We regret to inform you\\nof a slight change in our program.Harper Simmons has forfeited her slot...and her future.Since the next performer is warming up...we\\'re going to have to take\\na 10 minute break.Hey. what\\'s going on?She\\'s not going to audition.You\\'re not disappointed in me, are you?Oh, no, no, no. That\\'s not even a possibility.Is this is all my fault? It is, isn\\'t it?I came 3,000 miles\\nto ruin my granddaughter\\'s life.It\\'s not your fault.- Really?\\n- It was our choice.I love you.Here, take my picture, Phil.- Get in there.Uh, where\\'s Turner?You! Kid!Turner!<i>Bobby Thomson, up there swinging.</i><i>He\\'s had two out of three,\\na single and a double...</i><i>and Billy Cox is playing him\\nright an the third base line.</i><i>One out, last of the ninth. Branca pitches.</i><i>Bobby Thomson takes a strike\\ncalled on the inside corner.</i><i>Bobby hitting at .292.</i><i>He \\'5 had a single and a doubleÂ\\x93</i><i>and he drove in\\nthe Giants first run with a long ?y to center.</i><i>Lockman without\\ntoo big of a lead at second...</i><i>but he \\'ll be\\nrunning like the wind if Thomson hits one.</i><i>Branca throws.</i><i>There\\'s a long drive!\\nIt\\'s gonna be, I believe--</i><i>The Giants win the pennant!\\nThe Giants win the pennant!</i><i>The Giants win the pennant!</i><i>The Giants win the pennant...</i><i>and they\\'re going crazy.</i><i>They\\'re going crazy!</i><i>And home!</i><i>I don\\'t believe it!

Yeah!Wow.I saw it. I saw it, Artie.Call me Grandpa.My big boy. How on earth...?Grandpa taught me.Oh...Your father was wrong.So was yours.Oh, Al.How much would it\\nembarrass you if l kissed you right now?I think a lot.As soon as we get home.Okay, I look forward to it.Dr. Schveer, I shun you.You are shunned.My friends, it\\'s taken me over 35 years\\nto say these words...it\\'s opening day for the Giantsand we\\'ve got a capacity crowd.Giants are out in the field.\\nThere\\'s Charlie \"The Naz\" Naznic...batting .290, takes his stance at the plate.Yes, Art. Let\\'s see\\nif Naz can get his team out of a jam.Okay, Turner, here\\'s the action.Naz swings!He gets some wood on that one!Hard drive to Barker Simmons.Ooh! It\\'s through his legs.Walters has it. No, Walters loses it.Sherman\\'s got a glove down.\\nNo, he stopped to pick his nose.Now, Douglas is sitting down\\nand taking off his shoes...because his mom said to me\\nbefore the game...\"Sometimes he\\'s in another world.\"Sherman still working\\non that thing in his nose.Man, that must be really packed in there!You betcha!Naz rounds second, heads for third.Sherman has the booger!\\nSherman has the booger!I don\\'t believe it! I do not believe it!The other players are coming over\\nto examine it.I can see it from here!Wow, you could take\\nan aerial photograph of that thing!I\\'m sure there\\'s going\\nto be orange slices in the locker room...and a couple of tissues.Meanwhile, Naz scores.\\nAnd that is another home run!The Giants are still leading, 34 to 27.What a first inning!You\\'re telling me.I hope the second inning is shorterbecause grandpa needs a bathroom break.- Whoo!\\n- Go Barker!Our next batter is coming\\nup to the plate.He\\'s number three, Barker Simmons.Yeah, Barker!Young man with incredible\\npower. Three-foot-four and 45 pounds.He hits it to shortstop. Oh, it\\'s through!Barker heading towards first base.No, he makes a right turn!He makes a right turn.Barker, go back!He\\'s going the wrong way.What are you doing here?I just wanted to say hi.He just wanted to say hi.Well, I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever heard--Turn around, everybody.
