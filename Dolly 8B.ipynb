This process releases a great deal of energy.\\n\\nNuclear fusion, on the other hand, occurs when two or more light atoms like hydrogen, or deuterium and tritium, join together to form a heavier atom. This process releases much less energy than nuclear fission, but can create the energy necessary to power a fusion reactor. This can be accomplished because the resulting heavy atom is much more stable than its light counterparts.'}]"
