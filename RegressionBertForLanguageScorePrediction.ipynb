I noticed the furniture\\nas they brought it in.Erin noticed a little girl.But you were upset.\\nI guess about moving cross-country.You wouldn\\'t say a word.Just hugged this plastic doll\\nagainst your chest.Malibu Barbie, I think it was.\\nProphetic, huh?Think you mean \"pathetic.\"No, no.-I guess you moved on years ago.\\n-From what?From hugging plastic dolls.I should hope so.Last night, when you fought......it wasn\\'t about us, right?No. Married people sometimes\\nlike to......push each other\\'s buttons.It\\'s a form of intimacy,\\na lower form, nothing serious.One thing I haven\\'t said about Erin:It can be lonely living with her.But that\\'s my cross to bear,\\nnot yours.I think it\\'s past my bedtime, Terry.Of course it is.Let\\'s get you to bed.Terry.You\\'re not wearing\\nyour shoulder belt.Hey.Try not to make too much noise.\\nRhett and Erin are asleep.Okay?Hamlet senses something\\'s wrong......that he alone can set right.I want two pages next Friday......about what he means\\nand whether he succeeds.Mr. Begleiter, before my parents--They ever speak about\\nguardians for Rhett and me?Different from the Glasses? No.-I think they wanted to.\\n-They discussed it with you?No, but my parents weren\\'t\\nfriendly with them after they moved.Ruby, the Glasses aren\\'t your parents.They\\'ll never be your parents.-If Erin or Terry has done anything--\\n-We sleep in one room.That\\'s not ideal.The other night we were alone\\nin Terry\\'s car. He--What? What did he do?He just put my seat belt on.The way he leaned across me wasn\\'t--\\nIt just-- And I felt....I know it sounds stupid.And then......Erin was shooting up.\\nI saw her holding a needle.Anyway, she looked really baked.Ruby.Ruby.Try and understand this.The accident, in effect......orphaned you and your brother.So if this doesn\\'t work out\\nwith the Glasses......you\\'ve no place to go.You\\'ll become wards of the state.I\\'m not trying to scare you.I\\'m just telling you the facts of life.I drove halfway here\\nwith the housekeeper......and then hitchhiked\\nand I was scared.But I told myself once I made it,\\nyou\\'d help me and Rhett.When we met, you said\\nI could trust you.Okay.All right.I believe you. And I know\\nwho to get in touch with.It\\'s not gonna be easy.\\nI can\\'t promise you results.But I promise you that I\\'ll look\\ninto this. You have my word on that.Thank you.When we spoke after the funeral......you had said that......we had more than enough.How much would that be exactly?That\\'s a question for the\\ntrust officer at the bank.But between us,\\nfour million dollars.So you can see,\\nyou\\'re financially very secure.Yeah.Now why don\\'t you go home.\\nAnd do me one more favor?No hitchhiking.-This is out, okay?\\n-Yes, sir.Alvin Begleiter calling.I just had a disturbing visit\\nfrom Ruby Baker.Rhett, why don\\'t you leave that now?Go and do some homework.I have a lot of homework too.Stay a minute, would you?What you saw last night\\nisn\\'t what you think.Erin suffers from diabetes.I hid it.I don\\'t want you or Rhett to worry.\\nThe disease is under control.You saw Erin giving herself\\nher nightly insulin injection.Must\\'ve been a shock to walk in on.One more thing.Terry tells me that you got a\\nlittle skittish with him last night.That makes us feel sad.\\nWe want you to trust us, Ruby.We need your trust.I overreacted, I\\'m sorry.There\\'re still things\\nI need to get used to.We all do.We\\'re all under stress.I\\'m gonna begin my Hamlet paper.If you need help, let me know.That\\'d be great.That\\'s fine. Put it in park\\nand step out.And Ruby? You\\'ll get behind\\nthe wheel next.You can apply a bit more gas.Sorry, I\\'m a bad driver.There aren\\'t any bad,\\njust inexperienced.Take a breath, start driving back.Bye.He\\'s not in now.\\nI\\'ll have him call you back.He\\'s not in now.\\nI\\'ll have him call you back.Hi.-I\\'m Ruby Baker. Terry\\'s--\\n-I know who you are.Okay. Cool.I came to catch a ride from Terry.He\\'s having a powwow with\\nsome people now.-If you wanna wait, there\\'s a lounge.\\n-Okay, thanks.-Glass Transit, may I help you?\\n-Any service technician to the office.-What\\'s going on, Terry?\\n-The usual.Not to worry.\\nNothing that can\\'t be handled.-We had a payment plan.\\n-The dates arrive, the money doesn\\'t.About that payment plan.\\nNicole had a day......I\\'d call it unrealistic.-You proposed that plan.\\n-I know.-It\\'s not dishonesty. We gotta--\\n-What is it?NaÃ¯ve optimism.But I\\'m an optimist by nature.I\\'m betting on myself.I\\'ll be right there.-Where\\'s the money?\\n-You\\'re not listening. The money---Say is, as in, \"the money is.\"\\n-Yeah.Can I help you?-Whose car is this?\\n-Hell if I know. Showed up one day.-One day, when?\\n-I don\\'t know. Few months ago?-We had a car like this.\\n-You really shouldn\\'t be back here.Ruby?Ruby?What happened was nothing.\\nJust a business glitch.Hope you didn\\'t get freaked.\\nPeople get weird about money.I didn\\'t mean to just show up.\\nI waited for Vicki and she never came.We had to let her go.\\nErin got held up at the hospital.-Back up. You had to let Vicki go?\\n-We had to.She drove you without permission.Just to Santa Monica,\\nto the Promenade.How did you know that she drove me?How did we know? It\\'s our job to know.-Did you have a hard day at work?\\n-It was fine, thanks.Hamlet.Don\\'t you hate how he can\\'t\\nmake up his mind?To be, not be, not not be,\\nbe, be not.My father drove a Saab.Terry!Thank you.For finishing my paper.That would be wrong.-Ruby.\\n-Yeah?Come with me.Sure.Ruby Baker? I\\'m Nancy Ryan.I\\'m an inspector with Social Services.Your lawyer said you\\nhave problems with your guardians.Please relax and be open.\\nEverything said here stays private.Okay? So......you\\'re 16......and your brother is 11,\\nand you share a bedroom?Yeah, for now.And you saw Erin Glass\\ninjecting herself?-They said she has diabetes.\\n-Diabetes? I\\'m gonna check that.Now it\\'s gonna be in writing twice.My word still won\\'t count\\nnext to the Glasses.Which is why I\\'ll phone the Glasses\\nand ask them to meet me......so I can verify everything.-Okay?\\n-But......how can I live with them?-Do you wanna live with them?\\n-Sometimes things are fine.Last night, Terry helped me\\nwith something......but maybe that was\\nto keep me happy.I know this is scary for you,\\nbut don\\'t worry.We tell the guardians that we\\nperform a routine inspection.If it\\'s still in progress......you just act like we\\'ve\\nnever met or spoken.You have no idea why I\\'m there. Okay?This is my husband, Terry Glass.-Hello.\\n-Hello.Is this necessary in the middle\\nof the day?We\\'ll get this done\\nas quickly as possible.It\\'s intrusive.\\nLet\\'s get it over with.-May I...?\\n-Of course.Only one child sleeps here?Yes, Rhett.And the girl, Ruby,\\nshe has her own room?-Of course.\\n-She\\'s 16.Nice accommodations.The kids are home.\\nDo you want to meet them?Yes, I would. Just to say hi.But first, Dr. Glass,\\nmay I look upstairs?This is awkward,\\nbut it\\'s also important.It\\'s a matter of safety,\\nso there\\'s nothing......dangerous in easy reach.-\"Humulin I and U.\"\\n-Diabetes. I\\'m insulin-dependent.We have it totally under control.It would appear that you do.Here\\'s the two best kids in the world.Hi, you must be Rhett. I\\'m Nancy Ryan.Nice to meet you.So Rhett, how do you spend\\nyour evenings?When I finish my homework, I read.And you must be Ruby.\\nYou have a very nice room.You\\'ve made a wonderful home\\nfor these children.-Thank you, Dr. Glass.\\n-Thank you.We\\'ll see you out.You read? You lie.Guess who I learned from?Bye now.Why don\\'t we order some dinner, hon?How do you like your new room?Couldn\\'t have come at a better time.Come on, Mr. Begleiter.-Hello?\\n-Sorry to disturb you this late.But I found myself wondering,\\n\"Where\\'s the money?\"You might as well know.Six months ago I took on a partner.\\nA silent partner and......I recently found out\\nhe was skimming cash.You\\'ve lost me. What does\\nthis have to do with our loan?I\\'m waiting, Mr. Glass.-Mr. Glass, you still there?\\n-Yeah.He charged personal\\nexpenses to the company.When I want a heartbreaking\\nhuman interest story......I\\'ll watch the news.Meanwhile, your payment\\'s due\\ntomorrow, close of business.Do you fully understand me?Mr. Glass?I\\'m here.I\\'m seeking full restitution\\nfrom my partner.Plus I found a whole new\\nsource of equity.My big, new, personal piggy bank.So you can expect another $30,000.That barely covers interest.\\nYou need to pay off the principal.But I need some more time.\\nNot a lot more time.A week at the most.We\\'ll give you two days,\\nbecause we like you.We\\'d hate for you to find\\nyour beautiful house burnt down......with your wife inside.Yeah?\"I unfold a tale whose\\nword would harrow up thy soul......freeze thy young blood......make thy two eyes\\nstart from their spheres......and each hair to stand an end.If thou didst thy father love......revenge his foul and unnatural\\nmurder. Murder most foul...But this most foul,\\nstrange, and unnatural....\"Begleiterand Brice.-This is Ruby Baker for Mr. Begleiter.\\n-One moment.-Did you get my e-mail?\\n-No, Terry trashed my account.Or maybe the bill didn\\'t get paid.Did you find out about the BMW?Right, the BMW.It was registered\\nto a business: G.T.l.Glass Transit Incorporated.-Terry\\'s company.\\n-Now don\\'t you get it?Ruby, please come with me.I have to call you back later.\\nBye-bye.This is Miss Bassett,\\nour vice principal.Ruby.The paper you turned in to Mr. Kim,\\nthat was your work, nobody helped?-No.\\n-Not even Harold Bloom?\"Dance of contraries,\"\\ndidn\\'t sound like a student.I found it and other phrases\\nin Mr. Bloom\\'s book:Shakespeare:\\nThe Invention of the Human.We were told there\\'s a case of\\nplagiarism on your school record.You understand why we have to\\ntake decisive action--You were told?-By who?\\n-That is hardly the issue here.This sort of cheating\\nhas to have real consequences.We\\'ve spoken to your guardians.Of course you have.Frankly, we\\'re not sure whether\\nyou can continue at this school.Well?Why don\\'t you ask Terry?Or maybe it\\'s time you took\\nsome responsibility.Maybe it\\'s time.This is Jack Avery.\\nI\\'m out of the country......but I\\'m checking my messages.Wake up.Don\\'t make a sound.\\nGet dressed. We\\'re gonna go.-Where? With who?\\n-Away with me.-Quit it! You\\'re looking!\\n-Like there\\'s something to see.It\\'s raining.

Turn it off!-I wanna go back.\\n-We\\'re not.-What do you mean?\\n-Figure it out.We have to! You tricked me\\nand now I\\'m in trouble.-The Glasses tricked you.\\n-What?Did not. They\\'re sleeping.They were gonna send me away\\nand you\\'d stay home with them.I like Terry. I like Erin.You like the shit they buy you.\\nYou couldn\\'t see it.They made you lie\\nto that social worker.I didn\\'t know she was\\na social worker.You didn\\'t wanna lose\\nyour Nintendo.They bought you off.-Where are you taking us?\\n-The point was to get away.Crap.Don\\'t say anything stupid.The highway is closed.There\\'s a mudslide.\\nYou need to use Malibu Canyon....-Can I see your driver\\'s license?\\n-My license?-And your registration too.\\n-It\\'s....It\\'s over there in all my stuff.I think I saw it over here.Pull onto the shoulder and step out.Officer!These are my kids.Terry Glass, Glass Transit.-We loaned you limos for the parade.\\n-How are you?Rhett, poor baby! Come with me.We have a behavior problem\\nback at home.Your sister\\'s going through\\na hard time right now.-You know, teenage-girl stuff.\\n-Got you.Good luck.Move over.-You can turn around here.\\n-Thanks.Don\\'t you have anything to say to me?You killed my parents.That\\'s insane and hurtful.You\\'re threatened by your\\nbusiness associates. I saw it.Like Erin said to me,\\n\"We need your trust.\"You need my trust,\\n$4 million worth.I got a business.\\nMy wife\\'s a successful doctor.-I got a big, new--\\n-\"Piggy bank.\"That\\'s just words out of context.-What about the BMW my dad drove?\\n-What about it?!For their anniversary,\\nI lent them a Beemer......so Dave wouldn\\'t drive her\\nin that Saab......which I repainted.No good deed goes unpunished.In your trashy mind,\\nyou twisted that into--What do you think? Cut the steering,\\nstripped the brakes?Yeah.It\\'s understandable,\\nbasic psychology.You don\\'t wanna blame your dad.That he had too much booze\\nthat night.Then you\\'d\\nask why your mom and dad......hit the bottle.\\nWhose behavior drove them to drink?Get this straight.You and Rhett are mine.I suggest you forget your lurid,\\nadolescent fantasies and start--Help!-Let me go, bastard!\\n-Calm down, little girl!What\\'s happening out there?Your sister is having a tantrum.Come on. Come back to bed.Let me go! Get off!Let go!You...!Listen hard, Ruby.Anything happens to you,\\nwe got Rhett......and all we need is one child.Erin!

Won\\'t even answer my e-mails.What up with Little Miss Malibu?\\nToo busy bodysurfing?Then we are too busy for her.-Hello?\\n-Where\\'s the rest of our money?The bank sent me a check\\nwith the wrong zip code.Some incompetent jerk at the bank\\ninverted the last digits!So I\\'ll need another--We gotta expand the house,\\na wing for the kids.Our little boy gets bigger every day,\\nand the girl is a teen.I don\\'t know if you have kids....Anyway, construction costs\\nin Malibu are off the charts.I\\'m estimating a quarter million.We\\'ll need to see blueprints.\\nThere\\'s an approval process.You can\\'t get them\\nwithout an architect.Mine wants a cash down payment.\\nHe\\'s in demand.I believe we advanced you......$30,000 for that purpose\\njust last month.But that was for a room,\\nbefore I realized I needed a wing.Isn\\'t a guardian supposed to\\nkeep the kids comfortable?Here\\'s the trust.It authorizes me to use money\\nto enlarge the house.And guardians aren\\'t supposed\\nto suffer economically......in fulfilling their obligations?\\nI\\'m paying two tuitions.I employ a nanny. The kids see\\ntherapists to deal with the tragedy.I plan trips to broaden\\ntheir horizons...... and it\\'s like a root canal\\nwhen I need reimbursement.-Where\\'d you get it?\\n-You faxed it to us last week.I\\'m surprised to hear you have\\nboth children at Westcott.Did I say Westcott? We changed our\\nminds about it. It\\'s too glitzy.-We gotta do what\\'s best for them.\\n-Isn\\'t that the truth?Thank you for waiting.\\nI\\'ll take your order.I need five dozen\\n10cc syringes fentanyl......and I need two dozen\\n20cc syringes Demerol.We sent up 60 of fentanyl on Monday.I doubled the PCA infusion\\nrate of Demerol in six patients.Dr. Glass?I\\'m on the phone with the pharmacy.Dr. Wise wants to see you.The Medical Director.Wake up, Ruby.Sleeping Beauty.All you do is sleep. It scares me.So you\\'re losing your medical license.\\nThat\\'s wonderful.-I have a sickness.\\n-Yeah, it\\'s called self-pity.Complicated by being born\\nwithout a freaking backbone.So I\\'m weak, am I?Maybe I am.At least I\\'m not greedy\\nand reckless......borrowing a million\\nfrom loan sharks--Which should\\'ve been paid off!\\nWe had a good thing going......till you put your hand in.A good thing? You son of a bitch!-I was a doctor!\\n-Yeah, but you became a junkie.Not until you did what you did.Where were you when I did it?Right. I saw an opportunity, Erin.I saw an opportunity and grabbed it.I had what you didn\\'t.\\nI had the nerve, the will.Since nobody gave me\\na chance, I took it.I\\'m not doing this anymore.It\\'s already done.This is about containing the damage.\\nUnderstand?Good.You know we have to\\nget rid of the girl.Speaking of which, we\\'re dry?There\\'s nothing to take care of her,\\nso I\\'ll get something.If I can\\'t find drugs in L.A....Hi!Wave at the camera, Ruby.\\nWave at the camera!They can\\'t catch me!-Come in the water, Erin!\\n-Wait! I\\'m coming too!Spin me, Erin! Faster!\\n-Good girl.Rhett. Rhett, move away.Erin! It took some doing......but I found some\\npharmaceutical morphine.Erin?God, not now.Erin?Erin?1875 Montego Canyon.I thought you\\'d wanna know.Ruby?Honey?Terry needs to talk to you kids.You kids are a handful,\\nyou know that?Where\\'s your sister?\\nWhere\\'s your damn sister?I should\\'ve put you here from day one.What\\'s happening?He got the Jag.-He walked back in the house.\\n-Keep working.He\\'s sleeping.He fell asleep.\\nThere\\'s gonna be a change of plans.Why would he do that?He\\'s bombed!He finished a bottle of vodka.\\nIt\\'s right there.I see what\\'s weird.Begleiter! What\\'s going on?You ought to have your\\nwife take a look at that.-She\\'s not home.\\n-Your office said you were home.I kept calling but nobody answered,\\nso here I am.The bank blocked your\\nguardianship account.The officer believes\\nthere\\'s malfeasance.The sons of bitches!I went out on a limb for you.I warned you about the girl\\'s claims......about her accusations, because I\\ntrusted you, as did the Bakers.But if you\\'ve lied,\\nthe courts will step in.If they take these children,\\nthey have no place to go.He thought he was helping us.Mr. Glass, where are the children?At their music lessons.\\nTheir piano lessons.Next, I\\'ll have to buy\\nthem a Steinway......and the bank will say,\\n\"Can\\'t they play the kazoo?\"Shit!That\\'s my Testarossa.No, that\\'s our Testarossa.\\nUntil we get our money back.You planned to skip town today?Where\\'d you get that idea?-Your wife called us this morning.\\n-My wife?Before you leave, how about repaying\\nthe loan in one lump cash sum?He doesn\\'t have our money.-What\\'s going on, Terry?\\n-Ask him.-Your partner?\\n-Bastard robbed me blind.-Oh, my God.

No! Stop it! No!Thank God, Adriana.You\\'re so lucky.They thought you were dead.Calles is a monster.I know.We must find another\\npeaceful solution.Anacleto, the armed conflict\\nhas already begun.I say we support the rebellion.They\\'ll need food, medicine.And ammunition.We can support themwith communication and funds...but we will not fight.I kneel the first time.Ring.Then when I bring the Host up here,ring the bell.And then I go down again.Right?Finally.He\\'s teaching me to be an altar boy.You?I thought you were being punished.Hmm.Don Enrique, we have a problem\\nwith milling machine four.Grab those there.Ay.Beautiful.Look at this.Charles Lindbergh\\ncrosses the Atlantic solo.Me?

What do you want?Money?I can get you money.Spend it in hell, cabron.We have over 20,000 menwho call themselves\\ndefenders or populists.Most don\\'t even know\\nof each other\\'s existence.That\\'s why we need\\na commander in chiefand a central command.What about your military friends?Well, they suggested\\nEnrique Gorostieta...an experienced, decorated general\\nand strategist.He defeated Zapata.I know of him.I doubt he\\'s sympathetic to our cause.I don\\'t even think he\\'s Catholic.We are not hiring him to pray.He is a great man\\ncapable of doing great things.Close your eyes,\\nand sleep with the angels.I\\'ll try.Okay.Close your eyes.My mother brought us\\nthat vase from Sevilla.Sorry, Mother.You looking for me?He has to be dead.Let\\'s go in.You go first.Okay?Come on.Come out, cabron.Got you surrounded.We heard they rode by Chucho\\'s.We came as fast as we could.Are you all right?Who else came to help you?Go get the rest of the gunsand the ammunition\\nand their horses.We\\'re Cristeros now, boys!How many?- Six.\\n- Six.Four here.Four there.14.Catorce.Catorce.Miguel Gomez Loza.Enrique Gorostieta.Sit down, please.I represent the National League\\nfor the Defense of Religious Liberty.Maybe you have heard us\\nreferred to as the League.I have heard you called\\nby another name,Cristeros.Surely you don\\'t support Calles.No.He\\'s a barbarianand a fool.There are uprisings\\nall around the country.Over 20,000 men,but no leader.No leader?I am not what you might call\\na devout believer.We propose to hire youto turn our armed resistance\\ninto a formidable army.An army?I thank you, sir,\\nfor a most generous offer.Okay, let\\'s make an army.Let\\'s make a, uh, formidable armyout of a group of ragtag peasants\\nin huaraches...out of a few game ranchers,out of some tenderfooted clergywho are trembling at the thought\\nof holding a weapon for the first time.You want me to make\\na national guard out of that?Look at me.Do you have proper weapons? No.Do you have\\nan ammunition supply? No.Do you have\\na central command? No.How many is that?Three no\\'s.All you have is belief,and belief will not save them in battle.A central command?The League has an extensive\\nsecret network all over Mexico.Weapons, ammunition?From dissenters\\nwithin the army itselfand soldiers we have defeated.Surely you have read about\\nour victories in your paper.And your defeats.General, that\\'s why\\nwe want to hire you.And suppose I\\'m interested\\nin your offer.What are your finances?You gonna pay me in prayers?Tell me what you want,\\nand I will bring it back to the League.I don\\'t think the Cristeros\\ncan afford me.The question here is,where does the finest general\\nin Mexico want to serve?If I don\\'t take these photographs,\\nwho will?Who will record this barbarity\\nthat wouldn\\'t be believed?Why didn\\'t they shoot you?Heh.I always promise them a portrait.10 seconds.Miguel.Mijo, what happened?Are you all right?Yes, Father.There was a big battle.Bullet went right through my ankle.They killed my horse.Hi.I will get Dr. LimÃ³n.No, no, no, no.It\\'s better if no one knows.No one will know.I have known him for almost 30 years.Will he be all right?Yes.Boys, time to go.Don\\'t tell anyone what you saw here.Viva!Viva Cristo Rey!Viva El Catorce!El Catorce!El Catorce!El Catorce!There you go, Padre.Thank you, Pablo.The legendary El Catorce.Victoriano Ramirez.My brother Pablo.Hey.They should be here, Pablo.Bring them inside.Where is the general?I\\'m sorry.\\nI didn\\'t introduce myself.General Jose Reyes Vega.You\\'re General Vega?Yes.You\\'re a priest.I\\'m a priest.A priest general, huh?Oh. All right.Some water?Uh, what else do you have?Some tequila. Help yourself.You know, I--I heard that your last battle\\ndidn\\'t go so well.Now I know why.Really? Maybe--Maybe priests shouldn\\'t\\nbe generals. Hmm?Of course, we didn\\'t know\\nyou would be fighting so close.Did you know that you drove\\nthe federales right into our campwhen we were completely unprepared?You were completely unprepared?And this is my fault?I\\'m saying we should\\nbe working together.Under whose command?The League appointed me\\ncommander.Well, I don\\'t know anything\\nabout any League, Padre.I\\'m fighting for Cristo Rey\\ny la Virgen de Guadalupe.And I\\'m responsible\\nfor my own men.Together,\\nwe would be much stronger.We\\'ll stay out of your way.We\\'re going to Autlan.Jose, women are here\\nwith ammunition.Bring Adriana in.The what?The women\\nwith the ammunition.Que viva Cristo Rey, Padre.Que viva.I also brought three nurses.God bless you, Adriana.God bless you,\\nand thank you, ladies.You are as important\\nto this war as any soldier.- Gracias, Padre.\\n- Si, Padre.God bless you.Padre. Excuse me, Padre.You think that\\'s right to involve\\nthe women like this?Our Catholic sisters\\nare a big part of this war.Without them bringing\\nammunition, food,taking care of the wounded,all would be lost.Ah.All right.Do you need ammo, guns?No, no, no.You keep the ladies\\'\\nammunition, Padre.We\\'ve got plenty from\\nthe federales we\\'ve killed.What is the occasion?Hmm.- Salud.\\n- Salud.An attorney for the League\\nrepresenting the Cristeroscame to see me today.They want to hire me\\nto command their rebellion.You?Yes.Well, how ironic.You cannot fight for something\\nyou don\\'t believe in.I may have issues with the Church,but I believe in religious freedom.And I believe in you.And if I\\'m successful,the church bells will ring freely again,and our girls,\\nthey can continue their catechism.You are really considering this?Yes.Tulita, I have asked them\\nfor 3,000 pesos a month.That\\'s twice what\\nthe federal generals make.Plus 50,000 in insurance\\nfor you and the girls.They\\'ve agreed to everything.50,000 if you die.I\\'m not gonna die.So you have it all figured out?And where do I and the girls fit in this?Tulita, listen to me.I\\'m dying here.I\\'m a military man.You knew that when you married me.You a Cristero?You are an atheist.Are you awake?Yes.You were right.It would be hypocritical.I\\'m going to turn \\'em down.You may have nothing you believe in, but I do.I believe in what you\\nwould be fighting for.Maybe by doing it, you will, too.Just come back to me, General...to us...to the loving man I married.I promise.The American secretary of State--Como se llama el gringo ese?Mr. Kellogg.Kellogg...is making the outrageous remarkthat Bolshevik forces\\nare at work in Mexicoand stating\\nthat we have to guaranteethe life and property\\nof every U.S. citizen in Mexico.What does he think I am?Mexico will not tolerate\\nforeign governmentsmeddling in our internal affairs.Thank you for coming.Not at all.Dwight, do you speak any Spanish?Just a little.Look, I\\'ll be blunt.Our ambassador to Mexico\\nhas botched things, badly.You revamped the aviation policy.You\\'ve been General Pershing\\'s\\nright-hand man.I think you can handle\\nambassador to Mexico.Cal. Cal, my dear friend,\\nI\\'m honored.Don\\'t answer now.Think about it.Talk it over with Elizabeth.What\\'s the real story?President Calles is repealing\\nthe Bucareli Agreements.50 years, and our oil concessions\\nare finished.And what would you like me\\nto do, Mr. President?What you always do.Fix it.Let\\'s be frank.You called them Bolsheviks.I was simply\\ncalling a spade a spade.Would you have us just roll over\\nand let them steal our oil fields?And just how do you\\nthink offending themis gonna help our cause?President Coolidge\\nwants a diplomatic approach.I\\'m convinced he\\'s right.Half of Europe just became\\nthe Soviet Union.We need Mexico\\nin more ways than one.Well, I warn you from experience\\nthat there\\'s no negotiating with Calles.Thank you for your assessment\\nand your advice,but I am the current\\nambassador to Mexico.The results of your tenure\\nspeak for themselves.Now, why am I getting all this pressure\\nfrom the Knights of Columbusabout this conflict between Calles\\nand the Church?Conflict?Oh, that\\'s nothing.We\\'re Cristeros, and we\\'re taking\\nthe gold off this train.Viva Cristo Rey.You see?Que viva.It\\'s all right. Stand aside.That\\'s it.Excellent, Pablo.We are only after the gold.We are Cristeros.Don\\'t be afraid.Get the passengers off the train.You did it, Pablito.Well done!Pablo! Pablo!Pablo.Pablo. No, no.

Now.Go. Let\\'s go!Rapido!Why are you here?We want to be Cristeros, mi General.And why do you want to be Cristeros?The padre of the church of Sahuayo...was killed...in front of me.He was teaching me to be an altar boy.Marta!

Hmm.One of Mexico\\'s pre-Colombian\\ngifts to the world.Oh, this is magnificent.Thank you. What are\\nyour impressions of Mexico?Well, I\\'ve traveled in Mexico\\nnumerous times,and, uh, you know,\\nI\\'m always charmed.And it\\'s--it\\'s interesting,invariably I discover something\\nthat connects our two countries,chocolate and petroleum\\nbeing two of them.American oil companies have been\\ngranted a 50-year concessionthat I consider very generous.Please sit.Well, I understand there are some\\nin Washingtonwho don\\'t see it that way.We\\'ve been following your war\\nwith the Catholic Church.I would hardly call it a war.Terrible, what happened on the train.They were led by a priest.What does that tell you about\\ntheir so-called moral superiority?51 people burned alive.Barbaric.But surely that doesn\\'t represent\\nthe entire Catholic population.In my experience, it\\'s small groups\\nof extremists that start wars.In my experience as a revolutionary,a small group of determined men\\ncan bring down a government,and that is why every Catholic aggression\\nmust be responded to immediately,forcefully, and without hesitation.And if we continue talking politics,\\nwe\\'re gonna ruin our digestions.Ambassador, salud.Salud.Bienvenido a Mexico.Hey!- Victoriano.\\n- Eh?Don\\'t go through the canyon\\nto Tlaquepaque.It\\'s a trap.How do you know that?My scout was there yesterday.Let\\'s just say it\\'s a gut feeling.An ambush is what\\nI would do if I was them.Let me ask you something, General.I\\'m just curious.If we die, if you lose this war--We\\'re not gonna lose this war.If you lose this war,do you still get paid all the money?Or do you get, like, half?I\\'m just curious.You want something from me, Flaco?If we die, we all die,but my family will be taken care of.That\\'s very good for your family.We\\'ll go through the canyon.Of course you will.Go with God, then.Hyah! Hyah!Mi General,why did you let him\\ndisrespect you that way?Up in the rocks!They\\'re up in the rocks!Take cover!Que viva Cristo Rey!Wait here!Viva Cristo Rey.Que viva.Hyah.Muevanse, muchachos.Jose!Mi General.Chamaco\\'s very happy to see you.He\\'s very tired.I heard you saved Victorianoeven though he said those things.A man like Victoriano,\\nrespect is won.Look at him. Come here.Look how beautiful he is.He\\'s a Friesan.His name means \"little child.\"He\\'s a legendary war horse\\nfrom northern Europe.In the Middle Ages, he would carry\\narmored knights and kings into battle.His owner gave him to us\\nspecifically for our cause.He\\'s the only one\\nof its kind in all of Mexico.Go.Say hello.What\\'s it like to ride him?You tell me.He\\'ll need to be exercised\\ntomorrow morning.But you have to be gentle on the reins.\\nHe has a very sensitive mouth.And he\\'s very fast.He loves to run,\\nso you have to hold on tight.Hey, Chamaco.Bello Chamaco.But what\\'s it like to ride him?It\\'s like being close to heaven.Jose.I\\'ve never had a son, but if I did,\\nI would want him to be just like you.Que viva Cristo Rey.Que viva!Bueno....meijor fortificacion.Pero cuanta gente\\ntenemos en esta area?Aqui en esta area, tenemos\\nunas dos mil tropas--Senor Presidente.Mi General Ortiz\\nand almost 500 men are dead.Ortiz?That\\'s impossible.Who told you that?A counterambush, sir.Cristeros hired Enrique Gorostietaas commander\\nof all the Cristero forces.General Gorostieta is behind this?He fought with Huerta, sir.I know.I know that.What I don\\'t knowis how could someone like Ortiz\\nbe so incompetent?Gorostieta.His treason will not be\\nforgotten nor forgiven.Do you understand?Go to Los Altos immediately.Bring all the men you can.Yes, Mr. President.Go.Go!Gorostieta is back in politics?Yes, sir.But I know him.His heart is not in this.Find out what he really wants.What he--Porfirio Diaz used to say,\"A dog with a bone in his mouthdoesn\\'t bark and doesn\\'t bite.\"In politics, everything has a price.Go find his.How was the ride?Like flying, sir.Come here.Tomorrow morning,\\nI\\'m going to lead the men into battle.Want to carry the flag?It would be an honor, sir.We leave at first light.Today we are gonna\\nsend a message.We are gonna send a message to Callesand to the rest of the world...that freedom is not just for writersand for politicians and--\\nand for fancy documents!Freedom--Freedom is our home,our wives, our children, our faith.Freedom is our lives...and we will defend it or die trying!It is not only our duty to defend it,but it is our right!You must remember that men\\nwill fire bullets,but God decides where they land!Que viva Cristo Rey!Que viva!- Que viva Cristo Rey!\\n- Que viva!- Que viva!\\n- Que viva!My dearest Tulita...today was a magnificent day,and not simply because\\nwe routed the federalesin our greatest victory yet.There is a change\\nin the spirit of my men,a transformation\\nI can see in their eyes.They finally believe\\nwe can win this war.I know the federales\\ncan sense this, too.The scent of fear now blows\\nfrom their camps.We must strike them harder now,push them backso the people will be emboldened\\nto support us in the cities.Then Calles and his army\\nwill have nowhere to hide.My strategy cannot fail us,and I will be home before long.Keep me close in your heart, my love,and I will see you again tonight\\nin my dreams.This--This warhas Americans and other foreigners\\nreluctant to do businessor even visit,and I wonder if...you can see your way\\nto some kind of compromise.No.But if your country and my country\\nwould strengthen their ties...this could end very quickly.That\\'s not what I had in mind.Actual military support is--\\nof course, is out of the question,but I think a provision could be madefor the sale of American\\nmachine guns and aircraft.When can I get the planes?Well, Mr. President,first we need the gesture of goodwill.Now, I think a different positionon American petroleum interests\\nwould go a long way.I will bring your generous offer\\nto Congress.Forward!Mi General, here\\'s my horse.Hey. Hey, what are you doing?Come here. Come on.\\nGet on the horse.You\\'ll be faster alone, mi General.What are you doing?\\nGet on the horse.Sorry, mi General.Get on the hor--Jose!\\nThey\\'re gonna kill you!Get on the horse!I\\'ll be fine, mi General.Stay low, Jose!I\\'ll come back for you!- Take cover!\\n- Do it!Viva Cristo Rey.Que viva.Jose!You took his horse?You took a boy\\'s horse?He refused to get on.\\nIt was either him or me.Is he dead?I don\\'t know.I looked for him myself.He wasn\\'t among the dead.I think he either escaped to the forest\\nor he was captured.Send two men. Search for him.I already sent men to the forest.He\\'ll be all right.He\\'s braver than most men.This is true.Leave me alone.Get my horse ready.Oh, God.Victoriano.That is my boy.We let him down.He inspires me,\\nand we let him down.This is, um--Here.I found that...where I left him.That was his.Jose!Jose!Jose!Jose!Jose!Thank you.How are you?Not good.A scout tells us that General Rodriguez\\nis heading towards Tepatitlanto set up headquarters.This will be one of the most\\nimportant battles of our struggle.I\\'m entrusting it to you...with Pedroza and Victoriano\\nunder your command.I\\'m ready, Commander.You, Pedroza and Victoriano\\nwill be in Tepatitlan in two days.We can pull some more troops in.If you get there first,\\nit will not be necessary.You go into the city.You look for vantage points--buildings, rooftops, behind walls,sheltered places.There will be not one Cristero in sight.Padre, can\\'t you see the gun?We have to attack now.Hyah!What the hell is he doing?Fuego!Catorce!Did we get the--Did we get the machine gun?Yes.Yes.Yes. Yes.Okay.Viva Cristo Rey.Que viva.In nomine Patris\\net Fili et Spiritus Sanctus.Well done, Victoriano.Ah, Lalo.- Lalo, are you a strong rider?\\n- Yes, sir.I want you to ride\\nlike the wind to Sahuayo.Find out if Jose is there.You report back to me\\nas soon as possible.Yes, sir.You\\'re only alive because\\nthe capitan knows your padrino.Are they going to kill us?I don\\'t want to die.I\\'m scared, too, Lorenzo.This is what happens when you don\\'t\\ntell me what I need to know.Pull.No! No!Muevete.Get out!I\\'m gonna take you home, Jose.I\\'m gonna take you home.Just--Just say the words.\"Death to Cristo Rey.Long live the federal government.\"No, Padrino.They\\'re just words.I--I can\\'t, Padrino.Just f-for your mother.Viva Cristo Rey.Your luck has run out.- Bishop Diaz?\\n- Yes.- Bishop Ruiz?\\n- Yes.Dwight Morrow.\\nWhat a pleasure.The pleasure is ours,\\nMr. Ambassador.Would you care for some tea?Please join us.Oh, superb, superb.The prospects of the trip\\nhave improved already.Mr. Ambassador...who actually invited us?It\\'s important to everyone.And I\\'ve been working\\nwith President Callesto try and find a solution\\nto this madness.We are ready to listen\\nand to bring the message to Rome.Well, I know Rome\\nand the top prelateshave not publicly claimed support\\nfor the Cristeros,but neither have they disowned them.And in this situation,\\ntheir silence is deafening.This whole thing has been--It\\'s been an unnecessary tragedy.And Calles himself sees that now,and he\\'s ready to find a compromise\\nwith the Church.What is critical is that we reach\\nan agreement soonso that the killings stopand services can begin again in peace,and with peace comes\\nstability and prosperity.Peace and stability, Mr. Ambassador?Gentlemen, would you excuse me\\nfor a moment?Of course.Jose.Lalo.The general sent me\\nto see if you were here.You have to go.La Guada could see you.Hold on.I\\'m in God\\'s hands, Lalo.Go. Before they see you.A complete pardonfor the entire Cristero army?What should we do with\\ntheir leadership?Give them a parade with confetti\\nall the way up to Chapultepec Castle?Well, the pardon must be universal,specifically including the leadership,or there won\\'t be an accord.How many men did you lose\\nwith General Rodriguez in Tepatitlan?5,000? 6,000?Just how many more\\nare you prepared to lose?And Rome?\\nWill it accept the other terms?I believe I can arrange a meeting\\nwith the bishopsto confirm their support.Before I give you my answer,there is something I need to do first.What\\'s that?Go see an old friend.Frankly, I thought you would not come.You came to me.This is Cristero country.This is Mexico, Enrique.Please join me.How\\'s the family?Your wife, Tulita?She\\'s very excited.Church bells will be\\nringing freely very soon.Salud.Viva Cristo Rey.Your war is coming to an end very soon.You\\'re here to concede?Not quite, no.It\\'s not my war.It\\'s your war.You declared war on freedom.I know you for a long time,\\nand I know you\\'re not a fool,so you must know this war\\nis not about freedom,and it\\'s not about religion.It\\'s about who is going to decide\\nthe fate of Mexico and its people.Well, the people of Mexico\\nhave spoken.They did speak when they elected me\\nPresident, not you.I run things in this country.Not for long.An agreement is being discussed.Mexico and Rome\\nare going to make peace.An agreement?No one wants this war anymore, Enrique.Mexico is bleeding on its own fields.Mexico is hanging from telegraph poles\\nfrom Monterrey to Veracruz.Of course you need an agreement.But freedom has no compromise.By definition, it is absolute,and that\\'s why we will be victorious.Keep your agreement.Please spare me\\nyour rhetorical idealismand tell me,\\nwhat do you really want?Absolute freedom.Is that in the agreement?The agreement is all but sealed.This is yours, your agreement.\\nIt\\'s not ours.You\\'re holding your fate in your hands.The fate of Mexico,the destiny of Mexico...it\\'s in God\\'s hands,\\nnot yours or mine.Que viva Cristo Rey.The American Ambassador Morrow\\nhas made a preliminary agreementbetween the government\\nof Mexico and Rome.An agreement?\\nWhat kind of an agreement?The Church has been asked\\nto forgo half of its demands.In return, the government will loosen\\nsome restrictions on the clergy.What does that mean exactly?The extreme laws will be rescinded.Others will be...officially unenforced.And then what?With Rome\\'s blessing,the church bells could be\\nringing again within a month.My brother died for this.For what?Mi General,\\nwhat should we do?We will defeat this government,we will overthrow Calles,and we will establish\\na democratic governmentthat respects\\nthe rights of the people!Especially the basic right\\nto worship God in peace.And with God on our side,\\nwe will prevail.I wish I had your faith.Jose\\'s faith.I don\\'t know where to find it.If your heart\\'s open,it might find you.# Entre el cielo y la tierra ## Entre la luz... #In a few seconds,\\nyou\\'re gonna beg meto let you spit on Cristo Rey.Jesus nos da fuerzas!Do you have anything to tell me?Viva Cristo Rey!Viva Cristo Rey!Viva Cristo Rey!#...y sÃ³lo mi corazÃ³n #And what about going through Colotlan\\nto get to get to Tlaltenango?No, better through Aguascalientes.\\nIt\\'s safer.General!

Jews for Jihad.\"What\\'s wrong with being a Christian?Do you have any idea what your hateful,\\nbullying tribe has been up to?\\'Cause around here, you represent\\na whole new category of despicable.So if you plan on ever making friends\\nor sharing a bowlor seeing a human vagina\\nwithout a credit card,get in the closet, Baptist boy,\\nand stay there.Setting, conflict, climax, resolution.If the setting in SCCR changes,\\ndoes the conflict go away?\\'Cause, I mean, it\\'s only been a week,\\nand I feel like I\\'m someone else.Hey, Jordan.You sounding chipper.I\\'m not disturbing you and your gay lover\\nroommate, am I?No, there\\'s no roommates here.They\\'re just single rooms.You got to pimp out your pad, dude,\\ncatch some ladies.You getting any action?Uh, there\\'s this one girl,\\nbut I didn\\'t get her number.Or her name.Spent some time\\nwith a hot lesbian.Yeah, you\\'re full of shit.Hold on, bro.Sorry, dude.

There\\'s nothing\\ngoing on with Kenny.He\\'s just helping me through a rough spell.I don\\'t care if nothing\\'s going on, Mom.\\nIt\\'s weird.He\\'s a married man,\\nand he\\'s not a licensed counselor.He\\'s a pastor, Donny.- Donny.\\n- Huh?- Are you listening?\\n- Um,no, there\\'s just a guy\\ndressed in a pope outfitpushing a burning shopping cart.Is that a Catholic school, Donny?Don\\'t let them brainwash you.Can somebody tell me the difference\\nbetween archetype and stereotype?A stereotype is an archetype\\nwith no sense of fashion.Come on.

You\\'re into this stuff, right?Merry Christmas, dude.What?What do you say we don\\'t go\\nto midnight Mass somewhere,give old baby Jesus a holler?I\\'m not really dressed.Come on, man.\\nAin\\'t like your church.Not even the priest wears a tie.Nah, I\\'m not really interested.\\'Cause it ain\\'t Baptist?You all right, big guy?So when do you start\\nup in Canada?Not until February.\\nI saved up a little money.I was thinking maybe I\\'d\\nkick it around here a while,assuming you got a spare floor.Uh, bro, my, um...You know, I\\'d totally let you crash,but my roommate\\'s coming back early.Ah, that\\'s cool.I was thinking that maybe\\nI\\'d head up there early.They got these cabins\\nwhere the volunteers gofor these three-day silent retreats.Heh. I can\\'t shut the hell up\\nfor five minutes.I figure I might need\\na few practice runs.You still got\\nmy cell number, right?\\'Cause I tried\\ncalling you a few times.School has been,\\nlike, really crazy.Yeah.Yeah.Well...I guess I\\'m gonna go wish\\nJesus a happy birthday.Peace.See ya.It was good seeing you, man.Yeah. Hey, thanks for coming, Jordan.Hey, merry Christmas.Here it is again!\\nBullshit bookmobile!Welcome back, Reedies.It\\'s that time of year\\nagain to donatethose Christmas presents\\nyou are never gonna read!Come on. You know your\\nparents only gave \\'em to youbecause they are easy to wrap!Give \\'em the demise\\nthey so richly deserve!Put \\'em out of their misery!Give me your tired,\\nyour poorly written,your huddled mass media\\nyearning to be trees!Miller, you look lost.- Me?\\n- Yeah.Ah, it\\'s just a beer buzz.How was Christmas break?I don\\'t do Christmas.What you got going later?Sleeping off a holiday hangover.I have a little project\\nthat might require your...special talents.\\nWhat do you think?What?Trust me. It\\'s big,very big.Texas big!What the hell?Lauryn?She\\'s straight.What?Quinn is straight.She doesn\\'t even experiment.I know I told myself\\nI\\'d give it six months,just to see if she\\nshowed any sign.And then I...\\nI caught her readingan Anais Nin book\\nin the campus bookstore.I just assumed.Wouldn\\'t you assume?Told you her ass\\nwasn\\'t big enough.Stop, Don. I\\'m serious.I mean, I love her.Can I stay here tonight?Will you put out?No.Then leave immediately.Come on. Think back\\nto when you were bi-curious.Think back to when you were nice.I just don\\'t understand\\nwhat girls see in you guys.So you can move heavy objects?Big deal.Are there that many heavy\\nobjects that need moving?I heard the penis plays\\na role in procreation.Genitals are overrated.So is Anais Nin.Yeah.I\\'m sorry, Lauryn.Oh, man, it just sucks.Yeah.- Are you ready?\\n- What?- Oh, come on.\\n- Not you, too.Junior college transfers.What are you doing?I\\'m purging the campus\\nof false dogma,but I didn\\'t think for a second\\nthat you were gonna need my help.Do you know the Stone Age tribes\\nof New Guinea do not have cellphonesbecause they never grew wheat?\\nDid you know that?I didn\\'t get that far.Now you know.Hey, those cost money.I\\'m The Pope, man.I speak for God.God wants you to burn books?God doesn\\'t exist,\\nand here is the proof.Would a loving God possibly\\nallow this to exist?I think not.That was a graduation gift.Who made you Pope, anyway?Last year\\'s Pope at Renn Fayre.You don\\'t know about any of this?Big weekend bash after exams\\nat the end of the school year.Sex, drugs, naked elves.The firstjob of the new Popeis to take confessions\\nduring Renn Fayre, so...go to a little booth,and all the students line up\\nto confess their sins.They confess to you?All night long.At first, I thought,\"This is gonna be awesome.\"I mean, I\\'m gonna hear aboutevery kinky sex act\\nfrom here to Seattle,\"and I got a lot of that,\\nbut then...this one sad bastard,\\nhe starts telling mehow when he was a kid,this priest at his church\\nused to take him into his office,you know, and...right there under the crucifix,Father Feel-you-up would just...go at him.It was heavy.So I start thinking, right?I should be doing something\\nto help these people.I mean, I got the robe.\\nI got the hat. I\\'m The Pope.I should be using my powers for good.So then I get the idea.I start getting people to tell me\\nright there in the confession booth,\"How has God screwed you up?\"And maybe it\\'s the PCP talking, but...I find out how afraid people are\\nof a God who doesn\\'t even exist.Oh, don\\'t touch those albums.\\nHey. Come on.You know, tomorrow\\nmillions of peopleare gonna start filing into churchesand praying that their loving Godis not gonna burn them\\nin Hell forever.And you think burning books\\nis gonna help?It\\'s not like I\\'m torching\\nanything useful.Every steeple\\nhides a sleeper cell.They smile,\\nThey shake your hand,and then you\\'re drinking\\nthe Kool-Aid.They want to rule us,\\nDonny boy.They\\'re like Taliban in training,and we\\'ve gotta stop \\'em, you know,\\ncombine all our resources.Street theater. Civil unrest.\\nYou know what I mean?I don\\'t want to scare you,but there\\'s a lesbian in your bed.Oh, man, I need a beer.Get your shoes on, Miller.I\\'ve got something plannedthat\\'s gonna make\\nyour little billboard escapade.Look like frat boys\\nTPing the dean\\'s house.You want civil unrest at 4 A.M.?You\\'re okay with heights, right?What is it, Daddy?It\\'s a, uh, balloon,a happy balloon.\"Don\\'t let\"these people...re-prod-uce.\"Very good, Sophie.Hey.When\\'d you get back from India?- Was it you?\\n- Huh?The condom and the steeple.Are you wearing a wire?Answer the question.So you saw it.I go to church there, Don.You what?You heard me.Well, it\\'s not like we did\\nany permanent damage.I had a six-year-old ask me why the cross\\nwas wearing a baggie.It\\'s supposed to symbolize...A condom on the steeple?It was just a...\"Don\\'t let these people reproduce\"?It was just a joke.What do you know\\nabout those people?Whatever, you know?People can do what they want,believe what they want.It was just a joke.I\\'m sorry, all right?I had no idea you even went to church.You really believe\\nall that stuff, huh?Don\\'t patronize me.I don\\'t mean to.It just seems a little primitive\\nto still be a...A Christian?Well, yeah.I wasn\\'t born that way, Don.I read the Bible in Lit class last year,and it turns out I like Jesus.A lot.Does anybody know?Are you gonna turn me in?You know what? I\\'m leaving.H-Hey, Penny.How was India?It was life-changing.Did you take pictures?Yeah. I\\'m doing a slide show\\non Sunday night.I\\'ll come.Do you forgive me\\nfor the steeple thing?It\\'s not about me, Don.You don\\'t even\\nreally know what you did,because you don\\'t know\\nthe people that you hurt.Well, maybe I can meet these people.I\\'m not asking you to do that.No. It\\'s my idea.I want to.Okay.10:30, next Sunday.Hi, Mom.Hi, Don. Is this a good time?Not good.On my way to church,believe it or not.Don, I have some hard news...Hold on.Am I on speakerphone, Don?- You there?\\n- Am I... Am I on speakerphone?It\\'s fine, Mom. Nobody\\'s around.Don, can you take me\\noff the speakerphone, please?Fine. Okay,\\nI\\'ll take it off speakerphone.What\\'s wrong?Don, I have some hard news.Okay, I\\'m just gonna say it.I\\'m pregnant.I\\'m pregnant,\\nand the baby is Kenny\\'s.Oh, God.It was a mistake.- What?\\n- I made a mistake.- Hypocrite!\\n- We made a mistake.Bitch!I\\'m gonna let you talk to Kenny.Hey, bro.Put her back on.Listen, I know exactly how you feel.No, Kenny, you don\\'t know how\\nI\\'m feeling.You know why?\\nBecause you\\'re an asshole!You\\'re a puppeteering\\nasshole freak!Well, see that school has improved\\nyour language.We can learn much\\nabout the spiritual lifefrom a term used\\nin sound recording,called the \"noise floor.\"The noise floor is the amount of noisealready present in an environment...that, uh, has to be overcome\\nbefore anything else can be heard.Now, this concept\\nis particularly important......when it comes\\nto the life of the spirit.We need to find a refuge\\nfrom the often-deafeningnoise floor of life...to hear the still, small\\nvoice of God.Young man, may I help you?Yeah. Got some things to return.All right. Okay, you ready?\\nOverhand again.Okay, bring it back overhand.Hello.Miller! Miller.Hey, park this piece of crap.\\nIt\\'s about to start.I can\\'t find a space.Ah, it\\'s after 6:00.\\nI give you my blessing to park here.Yeah, right. Nice.Take the Bible. Please.It\\'s not that the book\\nis contradictory.It\\'s not a book at all.It\\'s a collection of writingscompiled over the course\\nof nine centuriesthat, when taken together,present such a hopelessly\\nmuddled worldviewthat it\\'s easy to see\\nwhy so many of its followersfor so much of our historyhave killed one another\\nover its meanings.Many refugee families\\nhave become subsistence farmerswho live in abandoned and often\\ncondemned houses and shacksand survive year to year by planting\\nwhatever crops they can.Mr. Larkin has set up\\nthe scientific methodas his biblical canon,yet with that method,he still can\\'t prove that a sunset\\nis more beautiful than...I don\\'t know, camel dung.Or that music is more sensible\\nthan noise.By his own reasoning,he is delusional to even tell\\nhis wife and children he loves them.There\\'s nothing delusional about\\nthe chemical reaction we call love.It forces the species to bond togetherand preserve the social structure,\\nnothing more.The theist has a sound explanationas to why humans need more than\\nto just survive.We long for love and justice,beauty, transcendence,because they echo the voice calling us\\nto know their origin.Okay, let\\'s take another question.Uh, Mr. Larkin,\\nI\\'m just curious...Actually, the gentleman\\nright next to the hat, please.Um, Mr. Larkin,in your book, you admit to a sense\\nof awe and reverencewhen you encounter\\nthe beauty of natureand the intricacies\\nof the universe.Has that ever led you to consider\\nthat there might be a God?No.Hell, no.So then where do we find meaning?Meaning?The universe doesn\\'t owe us\\nmeaning, son.If you want meaning,I suggest you try a dictionary.Yeah. Thanks.And on the last day,when I went to say goodbye\\nto the family,they were already waiting for me.Little Reena came up to me\\nwith a giant smile on her faceand handed me an egg\\nthat their chicken had laid.I knew it was all they had.So when you think of Kashmir...that\\'s the face\\nI\\'d like you to remember.Um, are there any questions?Lauryn.The amount of misery and suffering\\nin that part of the worldseems so overwhelming.I just... I don\\'t know\\nhow you deal with it.Is that a question, Lauryn?I mean, I don\\'t mean\\nto get personal,but I know you have\\nthese religious beliefs,and...don\\'t you ever wonder why God\\ndoesn\\'t just do something?Look, I don\\'t mean to go\\nall Mother Teresa on you,but she believed that the spiritual\\npoverty of the Westwas far more oppressivethan any physical poverty\\nshe saw in India.All I know is that\\nwhen I was there,away from all the noise\\nand distraction,I never felt so close to God.I can\\'t explain it.I just want to go back.Thank you.Don?Are you there?Don.Where were you tonight?What are you doing\\nwith my phone?Um, I fixed it with my hair dryer.You shouldn\\'t hang up on your mom.You didn\\'t talk to her, did you?We chatted... briefly.She needs you, Don.Stay away from me, Penny.Don!Don, wait!Don, she made a mistake.No, dialing the wrong number\\nis a mistake.Having a baby with a married man,\\nthat\\'s being a slut.You\\'re talking about your mother.Yeah, I think I know her\\na little better than you do.What else did she tell you?Not that much.Were you really assistant\\nto your youth pastor?Get the hell away from me.Why are you trying\\nto hide who you are?\\'Cause I\\'m done with those freaks.What, like me?- You wouldn\\'t understand.\\n- Why not?Because your mom isn\\'t having sex\\nwith a youth pastor.No, my mom is just roaming the streets\\nof God knows wherehaving sex with JFK.- At least she\\'s got an excuse.\\n- And what\\'s my excuse?I stopped visiting her\\nwhen I was in high schoolbecause I was too ashamed.Now I have no idea\\nwhere she is.I didn\\'t know.Yeah, there\\'s a lot you don\\'t\\nknow about everybody.People are human.\\nPeople are flawed.We all have our crap.I abandoned my mom.Talk to her.I want to be alone.I\\'m taking this.Don\\'t look at the flame.If you start pushing people away,eventually they just leave you alone...with your thoughts,with your demons,with the sound of your own breathing.But if you\\'re going to have\\nan existential crisis,Portland in winter is hard to beat.The city is a shadow.The clouds are a blanket\\npulled over your head.School year seems like\\nit\\'s never going to end.And it\\'s easy to avoid\\nthe people you\\'re trying to avoid.By the end of finals,you\\'re so burned out\\non the pursuit of knowledgethat any sign of life,even if it\\'s artificial,seems worth pursuing.Hey, hey, hey. What\\'s up?We\\'re almost there. Lauryn!I found her barking up a tree.\\nI think she\\'s dehydrated.Let\\'s get her to a cot.Hey, Miller! Little help?- Hey.\\n- Hey.Thank you for returning my e-mails.Sorry. School has been crazy.Yeah, you promised me last month\\nyou\\'d help me with this.I don\\'t do well around blood.Or that.Miller.Leaded or unleaded?Time will tell.So... your first Renn Fayre.What do you think?Snacks are good.You have no idea.You gonna miss being The Pope?You know, it\\'s weird.Certain people see the hat coming,\\nand it\\'s almost like...It\\'s almost like it gives them hope.Go with dog, my son.If God\\'s dead, what\\'s the point?\\'Cause people need this shit,\\nand they always will.The people with steel balls\\nare the ones who never cry out to God.I mean, they\\'ve looked into the abyss,\\nand they know, man.There is no one coming to the rescue.How do you know that?I know what I know, Miller.That kid,\\nthe one in the booth last year,who got abused by the priest...What about him?Nothing.To the great nothing.What\\'s this?It goes with the brownies.Let\\'s do some damage.Yeah!The air is heavy with anticipationas the silent crowd awaits the decision.The Pope has made his selection.Prepare for the crowning\\nof the new Pope!Candidates, present yourselves!Huzzah! Huzzah.Ah, this is gonna get nasty.The Pope considers the Russian.And the Russian has been passed over!Who shall it be?The young foppish prince?It is not to be, my friends!Will the ginger lady ragdoll\\nbe our new Pope?She is not.\\nThe rabbit stands alone.Prepare for the crowning\\nof our new Pope!No! The rabbit\\nhas been rejected.This is unprecedented!\\nWho now?!Who now amongst us\\nshall be The Pope?The Pope considers the Texan.What madness is this?It\\'s just a hunch, Miller.The Pope will now remove his miter.Hold your applause.His Eminence can be fickle.The Pope has been chosen!Citizens of the Reed,\\nwe have a new Pope!Yeah!Let the christening\\nof the pagans commence!Prepare yourself...to kiss The Virgin.Virgin! Virgin! Virgin!Virgin! Virgin! Virgin!
